Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining Atlassian's earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations.

Ian Lee

Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.

Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter fiscal 2019. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We'll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.

Statements made on this include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking results. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly report on Form 6-K.

In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available on our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.

I will now turn the call over to Mike for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A.

Michael Cannon-Brookes

Good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Q2 was a beauty, a great way to cap off 2018 as we surpassed $1 billion in calendar year revenue for the first time. In Q2, we had $299 million in revenue, up 39% year-over-year. For the quarter, we also generated more than $122 million worth of free cash flow. In October, we closed the acquisition of OpsGenie, a leader in incident alerting and on-call schedule management. We're tremendously excited to have them join the Atlassian family as we double down on IT teams this year.

IT organizations big and small are becoming more service driven and agile oriented and as technology becomes the key ingredient for growth and survival of nearly any business. We're excited about the role we play in helping IT drive that transformation, and OpsGenie plays a key role in strengthening the service and response muscle for IT teams across the Fortune 500,000.

During Q2, we also acquired Butler for Trello, one of Trello's most popular integrations. Butler gives Trello users the ability to work smarter and faster by bringing the power of workplace automation to their Trello boards. Individual users can shrink multiple steps into one, will have things like user assignments or status change based on triggers or rules that they set up themselves. It's a superpower that we're excited to bring to the millions of daily Trello users.

I'm also excited to share that JIRA Software recently surpassed 65,000 customers. This is more customers than the entire company had when we went public just three years ago. Including OpsGenie, we ended Q2 with a total customer count of more than 138,000. We provided more detail on these announcements along with many other updates in our earnings release and shareholder letter that was issued earlier today.

And with that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.

Bhavanmit Suri

I guess I just want to touch on a couple quick things, and I had just 1 question but with two small parts. When you think about the quarter specifically, I love to understand sort of the impact pricing changes had in terms of pull forward and sort of what the impact of that might have been, just some quantitative and also qualitative commentary on sort of how that played out to the customer behavior you've seen in the past year given the pricing increase, what they thought, share and et cetera, and then the pull forward.

James Beer

Thanks, Bhavan, for that question. The first thing that I really like to emphasize is that our key top line metric that we focus on to measure our business continues to be revenue. And that's because we are not like most traditional enterprise software companies in that the significant majority of our business is made up of either monthly or annual subscriptions or annual maintenance contracts. And we expect this to be increasingly the case as our customers continue to choose our Cloud and Data Center offerings. To further emphasize this point, again, unlike many other software companies, multiyear deals are only a tiny fraction of our business while pull-forward activity, by our customers, ahead of a Server price increase, drives really just a timing difference rather than a change in the scale of our relationship with that customer.

So as a result, we very much believe that revenue is a best reflection of the underlying customer demand for our business when you consider our performance over time. But more specifically to address your question around pull-forward activity, as we indicated on the call last quarter, we did see a significant volume of Q2 transactions coming in ahead of the Server price increases taking effect. And this activity came in the form of both early annual renewals and multiyear renewals. So this pull-forward activity, in essence, replaced what would otherwise have occurred in the second half of our current fiscal year or the following 2 fiscal years as well. In terms of the part of your question around the customer behavior and so forth, again, as expected and I must say I'm pleased by the overall reaction to the price increases that we've had from our customer base, and I think that's illustrative of the way we roll out price increases. We give lead time. And of course, accompanied with those price increases are very significant improvements in the product. We're investing heavily in our product every month, and this comes through in some sort of value we create for our customers.

Operator

The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.

Nikolay Beliov

I just had a pretty basic question for the team. You've highlighted 65,000 JIRA Software customers. Can you please remind us roughly the split between JIRA Core and JIRA Software? And right now, where do you think is the penetration of the potential market for JIRA Software? Are we in the second inning? The fourth inning? Just wanted to get the opinion of the team.

Scott Farquhar

Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. We don't break out JIRA Core and JIRA Software. But I think JIRA Core is a relatively recent offering for us, and it's still growing. So it would be safe to say that the majority of our revenue in the JIRA broadly, JIRA family comes from JIRA Software and JIRA Service Desk, and that's still the majority is JIRA Software. From -- I think your -- what was your second question, was around are we in the third, second or third or fourth inning? I think that's an American term. I think you have to translate that to like a cricket term, are we in the third day of the test I guess. And for us, like the way I think about it is the software market is growing incredibly fast, so every company is becoming a software company. So the market itself is growing very fast. We are growing or continue to grow our customer base within that market incredibly well. And then we're also growing our share of wallet within our customer base as we do more things for them such as OpsGenie, which we talked about; the JIRA Service Desk. And we also, as we start going adjacent into more likely teams, we're seeing that as a sort of a new market opportunity for us as well. So I feel very good about the -- both the TAM and the relatively small penetration we have within that TAM today.

James Beer

And just to add 1 point on to what Scott was saying there, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently came out with some data estimating that the number of software developers in the world is going to be growing 24% annually through 2026, so a very interesting illustration of the future potential.

Nikolay Beliov

Got it. And James, quick question for you. Long-term deferred revenue increased sequentially quite a bit. We haven't seen that in a while. What drove that? And what do you think the forward trends will be in the long-term DR over the next couple of quarters?

James Beer

Yes. Well, as you say, long-term deferred revenue sequentially was up around $14 million, and that certainly is a larger bump than we would usually see from 1 quarter to the next. And that was very much driven by this pull-forward activity that I was referring to earlier, in particular, obviously, the multiyear part of that pull-forward activity because the long-term deferred revenue represents activity that will be earned into revenue beyond 12 months from now.

Operator

The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

Ted Lin

This is actually Ted Lin on for Heather. I was wondering if you could just give us an update maybe on your overall philosophy on pricing. Historically at the teams, like you've gotten a lot of people in at a very low price to help improve willingness to pay. And so for a lot of your customer base, it's pretty high value-to-cost product. So how do you capture more of the value that you're customers are getting longer term?

Jay Simons

Yes. This is Jay. So I think you captured the philosophy in your question that we believe in providing incredible product in the most affordable price. That's been consistent through the company's history. We also believe on creating opportunities to land inside of customers where we remove prices as part of the friction. And so in OpsGenie, you'll notice that in October, shortly after close, we lowered pricing, introduced a free plan. We are transparent with our pricing. So across the spectrum of what customers can buy and how they grow with us, we basically share those price points so they don't have to ask. And that's effectively the philosophy. Where we work to participate in greater share of wallet is in adding more capability and more premium features that support enterprises as they scale with us. And so we've done that in the context of the data center product family, which we've talked about as growing nicely and continues to grow in the cloud. We've done that in the context of access, which is effectively a premium capability that supports a stronger identity and security management for customers.

Ted Lin

And I guess, on the core, given the strong outperformance and the strong pull forward that you saw, how should we think about kind of that impacting the shape of the seasonality of deferred revenue and billings kind of for the rest of the fiscal year?

James Beer

Well, I would just sort of reconfirm that, that pull-forward activity would have come from both the second half, both quarters of the second half of this fiscal year as well as the 2 subsequent fiscal years, fiscal '20 and '21. And you're right. By looking at that sequential part of both short-term and long-term deferred revenue, you can get something for a steer as to the balance of where that pull-forward activity came from.

Operator

The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.

Ittai Kidron

Couple of questions for me. First of all, since you know how many people pulled in revenue, can you roughly tell us what was billing growth without this pull-in effect? And then the second question, more in the competitive front. Now that GitHub is part of Microsoft, you haven't talked much in your prepared remarks about Bitbucket. But can you tell us if anything is changing competitively? How's momentum in that business? Is anything changing out there in the marketplace?

James Beer

Yes, just briefly to the first point. I'd just sort of reemphasize our focus on revenue as the top line metric that we factor to really understand the underlying relationship with our customers at the time. Scott, are you going to take the second one?

Scott Farquhar

Yes, I think you have -- acquisition from Microsoft, we haven't seen any material change this quarter in the competitive market. We believe what we have said previously, which is that Microsoft's primary goal in acquiring GitHub was to get more of their developers into Azure, and that's what we continue to see to be the Microsoft focus. So there's no real change in the last quarter on that front even with the changes in how they price GitHub.

Operator

The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Keith Weiss

I was hoping to sneak in two questions, 1 on OpsGenie and kind of the competitive environment that you see out there, where kind of like the combined offering that you guys are bringing to market is going to sort of be able to gain some competitive advantage. And then on -- maybe one for James on the operating margin side of the equation. Also like a really impressive quarter for operating margin. You saw some real nice year-on-year improvement. The guidance doesn't have that. The guidance is a much -- kind of more muted year-on-year comparing terms of operating margins. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of where those areas of investment are and sort of why, on a year-on-year basis, it would will be so much lower kind of improvement on operating margin in Q3 versus Q2?

Scott Farquhar

Scott here. I'll take the question about the OpsGenie in the competitive market. We feel incredibly bullish and excited about the market for incident management. If you -- so those of you who are sort of new to the story, as developers move their workloads to the cloud, as companies become more -- -- or the software company, developers are increasingly being on call. They're responsible for making sure that their code, it stays up to your production and performance. And when it's not, they need -- the company's being weighted with alerting their developers and coordinating responses. Now the responses could be around down time. They could be around security incidents, all these things that are involved when you're running a code at scale in the cloud. And OpsGenie offers a response and plays in that space, and we've been really very bullish about that. We have OpsGenie that does the incident alerting part. We have JIRA, which handles a lot of the tasks before and after, and we know JIRA is the way that our work gets done in organizations. And so putting those 2 things together is very powerful. And we also have StatusPage, which is the leading provider of -- StatusPage is on the web that need to get with your customers if you're having downtime. And so when customers have problems, they want to know that something's up with the provider, and we use StatusPage for that. So that combination of those three products is, in my opinion, unmatched out there in the market, and we're really bullish about bringing those together.

Keith Weiss

Excellent.

James Beer

And Keith, on the margin side of things, let me handle that. In Q2, obviously, we did see a strong operating margin really driven by some nice performance on the revenue line. And then on the spending side of things, both in the cost of goods sold, we saw some nice benefits there as we continue to work on the efficiency and effectiveness of our hosting expenditures. On the operating expense side, I'd point to some timing issues around the arrival of additional headcount and also some lesser-than-expected spending around certain professional services. So all of that combined to drive the Q2 result. And as you note, we are expecting margins to be lower in the back half of the year. So as you think about the Q3 story, there are a few different things driving that. First of all, Q3 is when we issue additional salary increases to our team, and so that begins to kick in. And also, Q3 represents -- so the calendar year, obviously, and therefore the payroll tax reset associated with our employee expenditures.

And in addition to that, as we talked about on the last call, we've really been putting effort and investment into our hiring engine if you will, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard. And so while we increased our employee count substantially in Q2, I would expect -- obviously, about half of that was driven by OpsGenie. I would expect the organic level of headcount to continue to increase in Q3 as we particularly invest in our R&D-centric model. And within the R&D area, we see a lot of different opportunities, obviously, right across our business, but I would particularly point to our Cloud products as a whole, to our work on our Cloud platform, which you can think of really as us developing common componentry that we'll utilize across the different cloud services. Of course, this will allow us to build cloud services more efficiently and more quickly as well as helping us adjust our ability, improve our ability to deal with larger deployment sizes while continuing to enhance our security and privacy, compliance requirements, that sort of thing. We've talked a lot about the IT market opportunities, so we'll particularly investing there. I'd call out OpsGenie as one clear example in that arena. And then I'd also point to the data center offerings for our on-premises customers. We've been very pleased with the growth rate in recent quarters there, and I would expect that to continue into the future.

Operator

The next question come from Richard Davis with DG Financial.

Richard Davis

CG, but that's okay. So I think it was like 85% of your new customers came on as cloud subscribers. Is there any difference in lifetime customer value for cloud customers versus on-premise? I'm sure there's a different shape in the profitability, but I've just always wondered about that.

Jay Simons

Richard, this is Jay. Not materially. I think as we've mentioned before, Cloud is a little more expensive than Server. We also have the ability to operate Cloud a little differently than we can in Server because we have kind of visibility into how the product's being used and we have kind of different avenues that we can leverage for cross-sell and expansion and kind of connecting to the customer kind of in product to open up different paths and avenues for cross-selling and other products. But from a lifetime value, I think they're pretty comparable, and that's seeing some strengths, I think, that the products provide themselves and the value they provide to customers.

Michael Cannon-Brookes

Richard, this is Mike. Just chipping one thing. When Jay says the customer lifetime value is comparable, he means on a customer potential basis. So we tend to calculate, for example, if someone is a 50-person company, going wall to wall in that company, we can sell 50 seats. If someone is a 50,000-person company, we can potentially sell 50,000 seats. So for the size of the company, our potential return or lifetime value is equivalent. Generally, the larger the company, the less likely they ought to choose cloud today. But obviously, that's changing on a sort of on a timescale basis if that makes sense.

Operator

The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.

Zachary Lountzis

This is Zach Lountzis for John. Could you talk a little bit about the Slack partnership, how it's going, the transitions from Stride and HipChat? And then any changes there competitively with Microsoft or anyone else?

Michael Cannon-Brookes

Mate, I can talk to that. It's Mike. Sure. Look, it's going -- I'd say the partnership's going very, very well. We have a great relationship there. We continue to work together and build out features and functions that help joint customers across our product portfolios to have the best experience that they can. We continue to move through the transition and migration period for HipChat and Stride customers. Again, there's about 1 month and a bit left at that, so we continue to work with big and small customers to help them migrate and to get into that future world. I don't know if we have anything else to call out on the go-to-market side there, but it's been going pretty well so far.

Zachary Lountzis

And then, James, if I could, the -- you guys raised that convert a few quarters ago. You're at like $800 million or something in net cash today. I was wondering how you guys think about the positioning there going forward? Any additional raises that you might be looking to make and what the ideal balance is really?

James Beer

Yes, I think the converts as well as our ongoing free cash flow generation provides us with substantial financial flexibility. So we're very pleased by that given the scale of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. So we're obviously very pleased with, in particular, the continued progression of our cash flow results.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.

Michael Turits

On the upside on the billings, how much of it was in addition to pull forward? May have been -- is there any particular shift to more data center and multiyear contracts either at data center or on maintenance?

James Beer

Yes. Mike, I wouldn't point to anything in particular other than what I've really commented on already. So remember that the price increases really applied to our Server business. We did not increase prices on the Data Center business. So it was really much more that part of the overall platform that we offer that was driving the pull forward.

Michael Turits

Got it. And then also a strong quarter on the other line, which includes marketplace. Anything that suggests any particular inflection there?

James Beer

Yes. We were very pleased with the marketplace performance as we have been now for a number of quarters. One additional accounting element sort of in terms of a technical issue is that pull-forward activity related to our customers buying marketplace apps. Our portion of those purchases drop straight into revenue in the quarter that they occurred since we've already satisfied any conditions that we need to be able to execute on at that point.

Operator

The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.

Rishi Jaluria

Two quick ones. First, just the stat you gave around cloud customers, that's definitely really impressive. It's nearly 75% of total customers. Can just give us a sense for how this number has directionally trended over time? And where do you think it'll end up over time, especially given that 85% of net new customers were cloud customers? And I got a follow-up.

Michael Cannon-Brookes

Look, I can answer that. I mean, directionally, it's clear in the numbers. As I said, it's more than 85% of new customers come into the cloud. I would say we expect that to continue to trend upwards as companies increasingly -- fundamentally, if you zoom out, the cloud can provide a better offering than I think most companies can run themselves, right? It can be more secure. It can be faster. It takes away the operational management hurdles. You don't have to upgrade it. So there's inherent obvious advantages in the cloud. Our belief is it's going to be a decade-long transition. And the majority, the vast majority of software will be run in the cloud. So we're seeing 85% plus of new customers coming in choosing that. It's logical that our overall customer base would trend to that and then continue to trend upwards as that's the case. At the same time, we don't force migrate customers. It should be very clear. We are pro-customer choice, and there's a significant number of companies for whom that's not their choice. That is a distinct advantage of Atlassian over a pure cloud vendor, is that we can provide a better, more holistic offering as companies go through that transition internally over the next decade.

Rishi Jaluria

That's helpful. And then one follow-up for James on the gross margin guidance. I guess just how should we be thinking about why implied Q4 gross margins should be dropping from where they are? And then with the AWS migration being done, what should the longer impact on gross margins be?

James Beer

Yes. So in the back half of this fiscal year, we'll continue to be investing in some of the data center infrastructure in Asia Pacific in particular, so that will drive some additional COGS for us. Over the longer term, obviously, as Mike was just pointing out, we would expect cloud to continue to steadily grow as an overall proportion of the business. And we know cloud comes with lower gross margins than the -- behind the firewall platform offerings that we have because, obviously, we're doing the hosting work, whereas behind the firewall, our customer is paying for that activity.

Operator

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.

Keith Bachman

I had two quickies and a longer-term question. But was there any inorganic help or was the inorganic help in any way material in the quarter you just reported? In addition, Europe looked like it had some strength there. Was there anything you wanted to call out in Europe as being unusual? Or what was the driver of strength? And then I'll wait to ask my follow-up.

James Beer

Yes. So in terms of inorganic activity, we closed the OpsGenie transaction at the start of the quarter. And when we announced that transaction, we indicated that it would drive around 1 point of revenue growth for us during fiscal '19. So that would be the only factor we would have got a full quarter effect of OpsGenie on the revenue side there. In Europe, what I would point to there is that our channel is a very important component of our distribution generally. And indeed, around half of our channel partners are in Europe, so it's a particularly important part of our European distribution business. And those channel partners in Europe in particular worked effectively with our customers around some of the pull-forward activity that we spoke of earlier. And some of that activity, I mentioned the marketplace activity in an earlier answer, does drop immediately in the quarter to revenue. So that would have also benefited that EMEA growth rate that you see.

Keith Bachman

Okay, fair enough. And then the question I wanted to ask, again, directional and philosophical, is when you're thinking about your revenue growth profile, there's a few things that impact it. One is prices. The other is mix. But I'm just also trying to understand how we should be thinking about subscriber growth as being a driver of future revenue growth. And is there any kind of metrics that we should be thinking about? Is it the key driver of your growth going forward? Or just any kind of categorization of how that impacts the top line.

Michael Cannon-Brookes

I can talk about that, I guess, philosophically. Look, we've been very clear that we have a lot of different growth sectors in our quite unique business. And that's a constant challenge, intellectual challenge for us to manage between the different levers. But I've think we've done, if you look at our history, a pretty good job so far. When we talk about that, obviously, you get the headline customer number, which was past 138,000, which is a great number. But that only means that, that is a singular domain, and I think it was a singular company that's becoming like a customer. They then have a lot of different ways to grow. As you've seen us over time build out the portfolio, as we add more products, there are more things that, that particular customer can buy. Secondly, obviously, the customers themselves can grow inside the product that they're already in.

So if they land in JIRA Software, they land in Trello, they're on Confluence, they can just literally add more of their company to that. So if they've got 10,000 employees, they might start with a 50-person team somewhere. And our job is to continue to deliver value to them over time so that they will grow into 100-person customer for us, then 1,000-person and hopefully to a 10,000-person customer. And that's just within our stable. The other thing obviously is things like the marketplace, which has been called out a couple of times in the call, which is an ability for that customer to grow outside of things that Atlassian builds. And we provide the platform for that to connect those vendors and the great ecosystem we have with those customers in a transactional way. And then last year, you've seen us, I would say, judiciously exercise our acquisition model over time as another way for the business to grow. So the headline customer number, 138,000, is a very good one, but we have a lot of ways to grow those customers within that number.

Operator

The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit.

Jonathan Kees

It was indeed a ripper of a quarter, and that's impressive given the gloom in June. And you see in the headlines. You read in the headlines in the news. I guess my question is more what concerns you in terms of the macro issues. Or are you not seeing much? I would think you at least encounter stuff like the government shutdown. You do have exposure to government, the federal business. There is indications of IT slowdown, and that would impact software. You obviously don't manufacture in -- stuff in China, so that doesn't impact you. But in general, what are the macro issues that you're seeing and that concerns you?

James Beer

Yes. Jonathan, I'll take that one. We aren't seeing anything specific in terms of macro weakness. As you point out, our exposure to China is really immaterial. And while we certainly wouldn't say that we're immune to a recession, we also believe that, as was quoted back around the IPO times, that our business is very much built for stormy weather. So the company has been able to very nicely weather the last 2 recessions. And I think our low-cost, high-value model is a big driver of that. And another thing to consider, of course, is that the way we distribute our product, it's really chosen by the end users rather than sold top down and pushed onto those users. And so feel good about the business model's ability to withstand a dip economically.

Jonathan Kees

Okay. All right. That's helpful. If I can ask one other question, you've mentioned that, James, that obviously, margins could be going down in the second half, specifically operating margins. Sales and marketing ticked up substantially on a sequential basis there and actually over the last several quarters. Is this going to be the new norm? I know in the past, you've talked about initiatives to try to promote Trello, focus on that first, launch across the world and then focus on monetization later. Are we talking about who are going to be seeing increased levels of sales and marketing going forward even beyond second half?

James Beer

Well, on the call last quarter, we spoke about the fact that we were going to enter into a specific marketing campaign around OpsGenie in combination with, as Jay was discussing earlier, the price reductions that we rolled out into the marketplace. And you may have seen some of that activity around the country. So that was a big focus of Q2. And I would say that we do have some plans for the balance of this year to continue to push on that IT market opportunity. The other thing that I would point to is Jira Software cloud was relaunched just back in October, and Jay and his team have been putting considerable marketing effort behind that as well. So I wouldn't necessarily draw a long-term trend around the current level of activity in sales, marketing arena, but we're very pleased with the investments that we've been making there and expect to make for the balance of this fiscal year.

Operator

The next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company.

James Wood

Great. And I guess, on that comment, the relaunch of the Jira Software Cloud and the increase in the user scale capabilities with JIRA and Confluence, I'm curious, are you seeing increased interest from your on-premise base looking to migrate to the cloud? Or you generally see kind of the cloud versus the data center base swimming in two different lanes?

Jay Simons

Yes. Derek, I'll take that. Migration between server -- from server to cloud has been kind of ongoing with -- as different segments to the market, to the point that Mike made earlier, moved to cloud for all of the advantages that Mike described. We also kind of opened the aperture on cloud to support larger companies where we moved kind of, as you noted, the user limit increase from 2,000 to 5,000 for JIRA Software. And Confluence, Confluence as we do that, it will open up the opportunity for larger customers to move. The data center business continues to grow for companies that, for reasons that they're choosing, want to remain on server but run our products at scale to support thousands to tens of thousands of users. And so I think the way we think about server and cloud still is celebrating the choice of a customer to run the product where it best fits them but provide incredible value in both server and cloud to support where they want to go and where they want to move to.

James Wood

And then can you give us some color on what the reaction has been from your installed base on the OpsGenie acquisition? And I guess, given the price reduction, are you already starting to see transaction volume move significantly higher? Or is there some time needed to digest the offering?

Scott Farquhar

Derrick, well, we've been -- it's Scott here. We've been very pleased with the response to all the things we've done. We've acquired OpsGenie. We've rebranded and we changed pricing. We put advertising dollars behind it. We've improved the integration to the rest of our products. So we've been happy with all the results that have come from all those things. We do have examples of many people in the base who have moved from competitive products to OpsGenie purely on the basis of our acquisition and knowing that the increased integrations will come over time. So we're already seeing some of that earlier on. And so overall, we're very happy with how that's working out.

Operator

The next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham & Company.

It's Khanh Ngo filling in for Jack today. It seems that a majority of the IT first responders are still relying on legacy tools like Excel to manage their loading system. So what gets IT users to shift behavior to next-gen tools like OpsGenie? And how far away are we from seeing like a critical mass of users rely on software to automate their loading processes?

Scott Farquhar

I'll take that again. It's Scott here. Look, we've experienced this over a long time. The majority of people 10 years ago were using spreadsheets to manage their software development process too. And as people had to move at a faster pace, those people have to be more collaborative, we see the shift to tools dedicated to this purpose. And we'll see that. We are seeing that today with, I think, first responders. There's a large number out there. And as you have to be more -- if you have to be quicker in response as you have to run more cloud services and increasingly, you become more of a software company, bringing software to your customers, those things need to change. And so I would say there's two areas of this.

One area is still moving from spreadsheets. Obviously, that's a huge opportunity for certain people that just aren't first responders today. Many corporate IT, they don't make change very often. They'll release once a quarter or once a year. Internally, it's a very convoluted release process been on in public cloud. And then as a result, when things don't change, they break away frequently. But we all know that these days the pace of change in the environment is increasing. People are using cloud products. And so whether you're internal IT teams or you're producing software for your customers, that pace of change means that you're releasing more often, you're going to have more downtime. And all those things drive the need for products like OpsGenie to help responders. So our views is like there's a lot of different areas that are going to be growth opportunities here not -- even for people that aren't using spreadsheets today.

Khanh Ngo

Okay, that makes sense. And as the features and integrations between Jira Ops and OpsGenie kind of converge, how does messaging around IT change? Do you guys go to the -- try to solve more of a platform solution, kind of emphasizing the synergies that having multiple products bring to the IT user?

Scott Farquhar

Yes, that's a really great question. We've now been known for 15 years now of being amazing for software teams and providing all the products that software teams need to get their jobs done from Confluence that handles requirements and documentation all the way through. And over time, we've seen IT teams start adopting those products as well, particularly in the software business but also the JIRA Service Desk across their help desk environment. They'll use Confluence, IT run sheets and run books. So we've had a deep presence in IT for a long time, but what we're seeing now is as we provide more of a solution, we're becoming more of a trusted vendor at a high level of the organization, COOs and down. So we now also are seen as a trusted vendor to provide most, if not, all of what they need in their IT teams. So that's the sort of market shift that we're seeing at the moment.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.

Patrick Walravens

Can I step back and ask how you guys think about when you should build it yourself and when you should buy it? And maybe you can use OpsGenie as an example.

Scott Farquhar

I'll take that one. Scott here. We have a strong bias to building things. We've got a long history of building -- bringing products to market. We brought Bitbucket server to market. We brought Confluence, JIRA, JIRA Service Desk, Jira Ops. There's a lot of products we bring to market. So that's our strong preference. We also have -- beyond that, if we -- the time-to-market aspect is really the reason we would opt to bring something in, where we want to move faster or there's an existing product out there. We also have a very strong marketplace. And where there's an existing solution in the marketplace, where we believe it's something core to our customers, we'd lean towards acquiring something from the marketplace rather than trying to compete with them. So we sort have a preference there to make things rather than competing with our marketplace. And then down towards that, yes, there's a time-to-market area, we will move to acquire something. On the acquisition side, we've got a very strong track record of success there in terms of products and making sure that they're successful inside the organization. And that comes from our strong bias on acquiring companies that have a strong cultural fit with Atlassian, a strong business model fit in terms of bringing high-volume, well-priced products and also having a fit with our customer base. And OpsGenie fits -- OpsGenie specifically, that fits very strong in all three of those, great cultural fit, perfect business model alignment and fits right into the customer base and the next thing they need to buy.

Patrick Walravens

And do you guys have -- are there still major gaps sort of functionally for IT ops? Or do you have most of what you need now?

Scott Farquhar

I'd say that's an interesting question. I'd say we provide a huge amount of what IT do today. So if I think internally the areas we're focused on, one is that we're changing that perception. So people do turn to us and will choose stable products and see what we already have to serve them. But we are also building and investing. We have a huge R&D investment to tackle the areas we don't have at the moment, and some of those are very small adjacencies on top of the platforms we already got. And you see with JIRA, we -- JIRA, we got this incredible platform in JIRA that handles all the workflow. And often is the case of just targeting specific workflows, I'd say, on top of the platform that we've already built.

Good day, and welcome to the Okta Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Catherine Buan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.

Catherine Buan

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Okta's Fiscal Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results. My name is Catherine Buan, VP of Investor Relations at Okta. With me on today's call are Todd McKinnon, Okta's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Losch, the Company's Chief Financial Officer; and Frederic Kerrest, the Company's Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer.

Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook, our market positioning and benefits that may be derived from our recent acquisition. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.

In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their closest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparisons. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our earnings release.

Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q previously filed with the SEC. You can also find more detailed information in our supplemental financial materials, which includes trended financial statements and key metrics posted on our Investor Relations website.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Todd McKinnon. Todd?

Todd McKinnon

Thanks, Catherine and thanks everyone for joining us today. Before we begin the call, I would like to take a moment to recognize this day of memorial for the late President George H.W. Bush. We honor his presidency and lifetime of public service to our country and our thoughts are with his family today.

Our third fiscal quarter was another outstanding quarter for Okta with total revenue and calculated billings both up 58% year-over-year. We continued to invest across our business, while improving our bottom line. Operating margin improved over 22 points and free cash flow margin improved more than 18 points year-over-year, making us free cash flow positive for the first time. We also had a record quarter in terms of customer growth. We added over 450 new customers in Q3, bringing our total to over 5,600 customers. Even more exciting is the momentum with our largest customers.

We saw 55% growth in customers with over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, which represents a record 100 net new adds in a quarter. This momentum is an indicator that identity is an increasingly strategic imperative for organizations in every industry and validates Okta’s approach to helping organizations manage all their identities through our independent cloud platform. As a reminder, we address two markets, workforce identity, the identities of employees, contractors and partners; and customer identity, the identities of our customers’ customers. We closed a number of significant deals in the quarter. I'll highlight a few of them.

First, Hertz Global Holdings, a car rental company that operates in 150 countries, is an exciting new deal for us. The company chose Okta to securely connect all of its employees to the hundreds of applications they use to run their business. Hertz will use our workforce identity products namely Okta’s single sign-on, universal directory and multi-factor authentication to provide a better and more secure user experience for its associates around the world and reduce IT helpdesk administration costs.

Next, an international financial services company with over 750,000 members, was a new customer identity and workforce identity win for us in the quarter. The company recognized that its outsourced identity solution lacked a full view of its customers and did not support its digital initiatives. They worked with Deloitte to find a single identity platform that could manage and secure both its members and employees. They selected Okta’s customer identity products to provide personalized experiences for its members and our workforce identity products, including single sign-on, universal directory, lifecycle management and adaptive multi-factor authentication to streamline employee access to workforce applications.

A noteworthy up sell in the quarter was the US Department of State, who had initially purchased Okta for authentication for its more than 100,000 external industry partners, but will now expand to its entire workforce. The State Department evaluated multiple identity solutions to strengthen its security posture and support its transition to the cloud. We believe the State Department selected Okta as its enterprise wide workforce identity solution because of our credibility across the government sector to secure identities and digital assets across a wide variety of users and technologies.

Okta’s single sign-on, universal directory, lifecycle management and adaptive multifactor authentication products will provide 170,000 State Department employees, contractors and agency partners with secure, seamless access to web and cloud based applications, such as Office 365, ServiceNow, Box and AWS. We are very excited about the customer momentum in the quarter. Not only are we seeing more deals, we're also seeing broader adoption of our technology and we'll continue to innovate and expand on our platform.

There are a couple of overarching takeaways I want to highlight from the third quarter. First, we are seeing traction with the investments we've made in our partner strategy, in particular, our partner ecosystem is growing significantly as the awareness around identity is increasing and the space is becoming better defined. Meanwhile, large players such as Deloitte and VMware have recognized Okta as a vendor of choice for identity solutions, which further enhances our positioning in these partner opportunities. We're pleased with our momentum and partner deals in the quarter, including the US Department of State and believe we are in the early innings of seeing upside from these relationships.

And second, we've continued to build out our Zero Trust security framework. Last quarter, I talked about our acquisition of ScaleFT as an important step in furthering our position in Zero Trust security. We believe that identity is the foundation for enabling Zero Trust security and we're encouraged to see that that validated both by our customers and the industry. Last month, Forrester Research published its first ever wave evaluation of the Zero Trust security framework in which Okta was recognized as a strong performer and earned the highest possible score in the criteria, people workforce security, vision and strategy and market approach.

We're very pleased with our consistently strong results and the momentum we're seeing and we think it's being driven by several factors. We believe significant technology transitions are pushing the market in our direction. First, every organization we talk to is on a journey to the cloud. Second, they're thinking about how to become technology companies and better engage with customers online or through custom and mobile applications. And third, security has become a priority at the highest level. As these transitions unfold, organizations are recognizing the critical role that identity must play in their environments and while cloud, digital transformation and security are top priorities, most organizations are still relatively early in their journeys to realize their full potential.

We believe Okta’s opportunity will grow alongside all three of these transitions, as they continue to mature over time. The market is validating our belief that identity is the foundation for securely connecting people and technology and we believe that Okta is leading in identity and winning for a few important reasons. First, we have a fundamentally different approach to the space than our competitors. The Okta identity cloud is a completely independent and neutral cloud platform for identity. Because our business isn't tethered to the success of specific applications, customers appreciate that Okta will let them choose and continuously adopt the best technologies for their business.

Our customers think of Okta as an independent platform that helps them futureproof their technology investments. Second is the Okta integration network. Because of the central role Okta plays for our customers, we strive to integrate to every technology those customers want to use with more than 5,500 pre-built integrations to cloud and on-premise applications and advanced integrations, the network security providers like Palo Alto Networks, security analytics providers like Splunk and IT operations providers like ServiceNow, we believe the Okta integration network is our single biggest differentiator in the market. The breadth and depth of our integrations are critical, especially in this industry because the kinds of capabilities that we offer are only as useful as the technologies they integrate with.

Many of the reasons our customers love Okta are the result of our long term and continued investments in innovation and Okta integration network. Reasons, such as the speed of implementation, the ability to rollout applications in days or weeks versus months or years, the ability to address a very complex set of problems with a simple and intuitive solution and the ability to keep pace with technology. And what we've seen, as a result, is a powerful network effect that is generating a ton of value for Okta, our customers and our ecosystem of partners. As we integrate to more technologies, we become more valuable to our customers. As we attract more customers, technology providers become more incentivized to integrate to Okta.

The third reason we're winning is that we're uniquely able to serve as the identity standard for our customers, because we offer a single identity platform for every type of user in an organization’s ecosystem, from their employees and contractors to their partners and their customers. Increasingly, we're seeing customers adopt Okta as this single standard and retired legacy infrastructure along the way, including both long-time customers like Experian, Allergan or Adobe and newer customers like Major League Baseball who recently presented at our Investor Day. They're able to manage and secure all of their identities in a consistent way from a single platform.

The last thing I want to call out that sets us apart is our customer first focus. We think of customer success in a much broader way than most technology companies, even most cloud technology companies. For most, customer success is about making sure customers are successful on your platform that they're able to successfully implement it and use it. This is of course true for us as well. However, since Okta is an enabling platform for people and technology, it has to be more. Our customers buy Okta to make the rest of their technology even better.

For example, many use Okta to automate provisioning from their HR systems to downstream applications, even more use Okta to roll out applications like Office 365 for highly distributed environments. Their metrics for success aren't just about being successful with Okta, they're about being able to automate provisioning through Workday to improve employee on-boarding and off boarding or being able to rollout Office 365 to large global organizations in a matter of weeks. These are the kinds of success stories we care about most and since we've done these kinds of implementations countless times, our customers are able to lean on our experience and expertise to ensure they're successful with Okta and the technologies we connect to.

In summary, the market is being driven our way, as momentum in cloud, digital transformation and security are all converging on identity and we're winning because of our independent neutral approach, the breadth and depth of the Okta integration network and our ability to offer one platform for every use case and our customer first focus.

Thanks again for your time today and I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the financial results.

Bill Losch

Thanks, Todd and thanks again to everyone for joining us. I’ll first go through our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 before discussing our outlook. We had another strong quarter with revenue totaling $105.6 million, growing 58% year-over-year. Subscription revenue totaled $97.7 million in the third quarter, an increase of 58% year-over-year, representing 93% of our total revenue, up slightly from 92% in Q3 last year. Professional services revenue was $7.9 million, an increase of 56% over the same period last year. Revenue from outside of the US grew 58% year-over-year and represented approximately 16% of our third quarter revenue, consistent with Q3 last year. We continue to view our international business as a long term growth driver and we are investing strategically to foster this incremental growth opportunity.

Moving on to billings, the current portion of calculated billings growth for the quarter was 57% year-over-year. Total calculated billings for the third quarter totaled $124 million, an increase of 58% over Q3 last year. We're very pleased with our calculated billings growth and the underlying demand that continues to drive our business. Contributing to our high billings growth rate was better than expected bookings linearity in the quarter and the beneficial timing of certain invoices.

Our growth has benefited from momentum of new customer additions as well as upsells within our customer base, across all of our segments. The total number of customers at the end of the quarter was over 5600, up 42% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from Q2. We saw broad additions across our enterprise customer base and added a record number of net new customers with a annual recurring revenue greater than $100,000, up 100 from the previous quarter to 937, representing a 55% year-over-year growth. Our dollar based retention rate for the trailing 12 months ended October 31 remains strong at 120%, demonstrating the ongoing success we're having expanding within our existing customer base.

Before turning to expense items and profitability, I would like to point out that I will be discussing non-GAAP results going forward. Our GAAP financial results along with the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release as well as the supplemental materials posted on our Investor Relations website.

Subscription gross margin continues to be strong at 82.2%, up 180 basis points versus the third quarter last year. Our professional services gross margin was negative 3.2% compared to negative 30.6% in the third quarter last year, primarily due to strong utilization and improving operational leverage. Total gross margin was 75.8% in the third quarter, up 380 basis points year-over-year. Gross profit was $80 million, up 66% year-over-year. Our gross margin represented a new record high, as we continue to scale our platform.

Turning now to operating expenses, sales and marketing expense for Q3 was $50.7 million compared to $43.7 million in Q3 last year. This represents 48% of total revenue, an improvement from 65% in the third quarter last year. This year-over-year improvement was aided by the expense impact due to the timing of Oktane, our annual customer event, which was held in Q3 of last year, but in Q2 this year.

R&D expense in Q3 was $21.3 million compared to $14 million in Q3 last year. This represents a growth rate of 52%, as we continue to invest significantly in the Okta identity platform and our Okta integration network. At the same time, R&D as a percentage of revenue remained fairly consistent at 20% compared to 21% in Q3 last year. G&A expense was $14.5 million for the third quarter, compared to $9.9 million in the third quarter of last year. G&A was 14% of revenue, an improvement from 15% for Q3 last year.

Our total headcount was 1,473 as of October 31, growing 29% over Q3 of last year. We are adding headcount across the board to support the growth of our business and expect headcount growth to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter, as we further invest in our go-to-market initiatives and innovation across our platform capabilities. We remain focused on durable growth and as a result, we've seen continued improvement in our operating margin, while maintaining strong top line growth.

Operating loss in the quarter was $6.5 million, which is a margin of negative 6.1%, compared to a negative 28.9% in the same period last year, a significant improvement of over 22 points. Net loss per share in Q3 was $0.04 with 109 million basic shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss per share in Q3 last year of $0.19 with 95 million basic shares outstanding at the time.

Operating cash flow was positive $6.4 million in Q3. Operating cash flow margin was 6.1% compared to negative 14.2% in Q3 last year, an improvement of over 20 points. Our top line outperformance and continued margin improvement resulted in positive free cash flow in the quarter for the first time. Free cash flow came in at a positive $1.4 million in the quarter. Free cash flow margin was 1.3%, an improvement of over 18 points compared to a negative 16.8% for Q3 last year.

We are particularly pleased with this, given the impact we saw with CapEx in the quarter due to our ongoing headquarter office expansion. While we are encouraged by our strong cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to expect to see variability in free cash flow margin due to this expansion along with ongoing fluctuations in working capital.

Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $546 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. This includes the net proceeds of $307 million from the convertible senior notes we issued in Q1.

Moving on to guidance, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect total revenue of $107 million to $108 million, representing a growth rate of 39% to 40% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating loss of $12.5 million to $11.5 million, non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.09 to $0.08, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 110 million.

For the full year of fiscal 2019, we now expect total revenue of $391 million to $392 million, representing a growth rate of 52% to 53% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating loss of $49 million to $48 million, non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.37 to $0.36, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 107 million.

Although we are still early in financial planning for fiscal 2020, I would like to provide a preliminary view, as you look at your models for next year. We currently estimate revenue for fiscal year 2020 to be between $510 million and $520 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 33%.

In summary, I'm pleased with our consistent execution and the results we reported this quarter. We remain committed to durable growth as outlined at our Investor Day in October. We see this growth coming from customer momentum, partners’ channel traction, international expansion and innovation in our platform and network. In particular this quarter, we're excited about the continued traction we see across our partner ecosystem. We remain confident in our positioning and long-term strategy.

As Todd mentioned, we see benefit from the market tailwinds that are elevating the need for identity. These tailwinds, in addition to the success we've seen with our leading platform integration network and customer-first approach, continue to put us in a winning position. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to closing out the year on a strong note.

With that, Todd, Frederic and I will take your questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question today from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.

Sterling Auty

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I believe, Microsoft Azure Active Directory had a couple of notable outages in the recent past year, and I'm just wondering if that's actually changed the kind of conversations or the number of discussions driving more interest in your solution or is it even having an adverse effect where companies are perhaps nervous about identity in the cloud?

Todd McKinnon

Hey, Sterling. It's a good question. We're having so many conversations with so many customers and they all follow kind of the same key big trends. One is just customers need help adopting more cloud. They're thinking about apps, Office 365, Google Apps or thinking about infrastructure, Amazon, Azure, they're thinking about business app, Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and there's lots of different -- the reliability, as you mentioned, is one thing, but there's just a whole host of things they're trying to figure out.

And they're trying to figure out security to make sure these apps are accessible and secure, they're trying to figure out how to get the most business benefits out of it, and they are increasingly realizing that identity is the key to a lot of that, if you want to do secure deployments, if you want to do quick deployments, if you want to do deployments that will get the business benefits, you have to have your identity story straight.

Vis-a-vis Microsoft specifically, one thing that's interesting is that, because of our breadth of customers, now over 5,600 customers and many, many of those customers using some technology from Microsoft, we actually get visibility into the reliability of Microsoft's products. So we actually -- it's not just in conversations with customers, it's actually in conversations with the prospective customers, but it's conversations with existing customers talking about what was the extent of this outage, can you understand how broadly the impact was.

So we're able to help customers understand the breadth of some of the technology choices they are using and the pros and cons, and that's the benefit of being this independent and neutral platform. So it is -- I would say, it is something we see, but in the grand scheme of things, it's one of the many conversations we're having.

Sterling Auty

All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up on Zero Trust. How should we think about what portion of the Zero Trust architecture that Okta will ultimately provide? And I guess what I'm thinking about is, it seems like in some of these models, you'll have some of the cloud gateway companies playing a role as well. So is that an area where we should look for increased partnership from Okta moving forward?

Todd McKinnon

It's a good question. So Zero Trust is the term in the industry these days. It's a fairly recent term in the industry, which basically means don't trust the network, give the user the same experience regardless of whether it's an internal network or a network from home or a network from a coffee shop, give them the same experience, same grade ease of use and most importantly same grade security. So many times, customers aren't asking for Zero Trust per se, they're asking for how do you make this all secure. And they're saying, we love the cloud, we’re trying to build better customer facing applications, but security is paramount and we need help securing that all. And what they are increasingly realizing is that identity is the key to that. You have to control identity to give a really great user experience and a secure user experience.

So now Zero Trust is the industry trying to put a design pattern in place around what this truly looks like and what are the different components you need and what do you need on the client, what do you need on the device, what do you need in terms of, as you mentioned, gateways and other things. And there's -- people have different opinions, but one thing that's becoming very clear is that you have to have identity covered well and you have to have a good identity backbone to do security and to do Zero Trust.

So I think what you'll see is, and you see it in our results that identity is prevalent and pervasive and especially as customers do more cloud, do more and want to be more secure and then the actual details of that, whether you need a gateway or whether, how the VPNs fit in, those details will be figured out over time, but identity is going to be at the core.

Operator

Next we’ll hear from Terry Tillman with SunTrust.

Terry Tillman

Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and great set of results. Maybe the first question, because we heard a lot in your prepared remarks about partner momentum. I know earlier in the year, it sounded -- it looked like you all kind of refined your partner program with Partner Connect and maybe redesigned it. So I don't know if some of that's behind, kind of, this amped up success with partners, but maybe you can just talk about some of the things structurally you've been doing around partnering and then maybe more specifically VMware and Deloitte, a little bit more specificity in terms of the momentum with them?

Frederic Kerrest

Yeah, absolutely. Hi, Terry, this is Frederic. Happy to talk about that. I think you bring up a very important point, which is the importance of partners in our business, it's something we've obviously been working on for a number of years. These things are not things that you can just turn on overnight. I think you highlighted a couple of examples of some of the big categories that I would point to and that we see a lot of momentum growing in our business.

The first one are the global system integrators, you mentioned Deloitte, but also some of the other folks that are out there as strategic advisors and implementers to large enterprise and public organization. Deloitte is doing very well. I was just actually in Europe last week with a number of our customers opening up our France office and had an opportunity to speak with some of the senior partners there and they are as excited in Europe as they are in North America to work with us, both on the security implementation side, but also on these large digital transformation projects that they want to be involved with.

The second piece are very large technology partnerships that are starting to come into play. Again, you mentioned a very important one, VMware. For those of you who might not remember all the details, we announced an important partnership that we started last May at Oktane with VMware with first technology and business integrations between our teams. We furthered that VMware's VMworld and VMworld Europe, Barcelona, in early November where we talked about the second level of now technology integration as well as extending that partnership out to VMware's channel. And again in Europe last week, I heard from a lot of folks in VMware channel who are very excited about this partnership as well as customers and prospects excited to seeing us work with such a large important company and important piece of technology for them.

And then, finally, I would just point to the Okta Integration Network, which continues to be the de facto standard in the industry for the best and broadest, deepest integrations across thousands of not only applications, but pieces of infrastructure, networking gear and everything else with dozens of advanced integrations that are really benefiting our customers where they find these solutions end to end, drive a lot of value. So, we are seeing a lot across all the different pieces of our partner ecosystems, which we continue to invest in, but, like our business, these are early days and the opportunities ahead are very large and we're excited to keep building upon these results.

Todd McKinnon

Yeah. And I would add, Terry, that the programmatic things that Frederic talked about are very important. But one thing I've noticed is that, the business results we're showing are really motivating the partners. So if you talk about hundred new deals over $100,000 in ARR, partners notice that as well and they want to be on-board with this, the latest trends, and the leader in this industry and that's the business success and the momentum in the market has driven the partner momentum as much as anything else we've done programmatically.

Terry Tillman

That's great. Thanks to both of you for the answer. And I guess just my quick follow-up is on threat insights. Todd, I know earlier in the year, you all kind of unveiled kind of where you could go with all the analytics horsepower, it looked like the way some of this can work is, you have to buy the higher price point to SSO or the MFA product to get access to it. But what can you just do in terms of an update on threat insights. How it's being received and just where you are with that? Thanks, again.

Todd McKinnon

Threat insights is essentially -- it's really important for the value it delivers to customers and it delivers value in a way that's pretty special, because we see so many customers and so many logins, we can detect threats across the entire ecosystem and then we can expose that threat intelligence back to individual customers and let them configure policies in Okta that would make a certain decision based on those threats that are relevant to an individual customer, so it's -- because we see the data, we can make the product more valuable for individual customers and it's one of the benefits of being on the cloud platform.

Threat insights is going very well. We are continuing to roll it out and uptake has been very positive. We're working with -- getting a lot of feedback from customers, not just in threat insights, but in the overall policy engine and continuously innovating around the capabilities, as we do for all of our features. We have this model, this cloud model, which allows us to continuously release features and functions, but also the data changes all the time. So as threats emerge, it's updated real time in threat insights, so it's a very powerful capability that’s been well received by the customer base.

We’ll now hear from Alex Henderson with Needham.

Alex Henderson

Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape relative to Cisco's acquisition of Duo and to what extent you're seeing any change in the behavior of customers that they have been associated with or to what extent, as you're going through your competitive processes, you are taking more business from that channel or what -- any change in that dynamic?

Todd McKinnon

We haven't seen a change. The big picture is that there are a lot of deals. I mean, the market is really accelerating. There are a lot of deals. And we -- the overall competitive trends are very consistent with what we've seen. Our win rates have been consistent for several years with respect to all the competitors. And then the competitors are different, like it's very different when you're competing with someone like a Microsoft, where the dynamic is, customers, they really don't want to be locked into Microsoft.

They're worried about lock in to a certain platform, particularly Microsoft, so there, it's about this broad identity platform that can support multiple technologies, give the customer choice freedom from kind of being driven down a certain path, that's powerful to them. Different competitors are different. So maybe a legacy competitor, it's all about a product set that's not being updated or not being migrated to the modern environment and they see us as their pathway to the future, the pathway to the cloud, the pathway to digital transformation or a point competitor maybe that just doesn't have the breadth of coverage and can't get in deals and can't cover the field or maybe it's just more of a niche solution not a broader platform.

So I think back to your question about Duo and Cisco, first of all, you've asked the question about competitive, but I would first say is that, we're very strong partners with both Cisco and with Duo. Duo, we have a seamless integration with Duo on our platform. We have a very seamless integration with Cisco, their firewall products. So, we're very, very happy with those partnerships and those continue to be very productive.

On the competitive side, we do have some product overlap with Duo and we continue to compete with them and I think it's natural that you're going to see any time there's a big acquisition like that, you're going to see some disruption in terms of the execution of them independently and I think we are seeing that to some degree, but we think that the partnership will continue and where we compete we'll compete and the environment will be consistent over time and the big picture is, it's -- there's a lot of value to be created for customers and we're busy trying to capture and deliver that as much as possible.

Alex Henderson

So, one broader question. So clearly, as we're moving to a world where the center of gravity of security is moving out of the enterprise and into the cloud, the architecture of security delivery has to change and I assume that no single company is going to be able to provide the full platform. In that environment where we're federating multiple security clouds together, does Okta end up being the primary connective tissue between them? And if that's the case, what role do you play in the policy piece of that?

Todd McKinnon

Well, I think, if you think about the definition of the word platform, at least, how we think about it, a platform by definition is a set of underlying capabilities that then other people build on top of to provide the full set of value to the ecosystem. So if you think of like Windows, Microsoft couldn't build every application, so they’ve built the Windows platform and then the app developer community built all the applications. If you think about -- there is other example, iOS, right, Apple couldn't build all the apps into IOS, so they opened up this platform, the App Store, and then developers build it.

So we think of -- when you say the entire security ecosystem, we absolutely agree. We think that no one company can build it all, it's all about choice for the customers, but then you get back -- down to like, what is the platform and what is the right thing to pivot off of to be the basic thing you need to have a handle on that then other people can build around, for us that's identity. We think by being a system of record for identity, we can be that foundational platform and other people can build around us. So the way we think about the world is, we're the identity platform and then all these other adjacent categories will plug into us and provide the application for our platforms. So that's how we think about the world and I think it's -- if you think about looking at how we're investing in the product, it's consistent with that.

Frederic Kerrest

I think, Alex, just to add on that, you see that also from a customer perspective, I mean, what they say is, they’re very excited about a lot of the advanced integrations that we have in the Okta integration network, because it allows them to leverage the investments that they've made, for example, in Palo Alto Networks, get it pre-integrated with Okta, in that way, they can get more value out of both of the solutions, the Palo Alto Networks' Firewall can talk to Okta and back and forth. So, you actually get more information by connecting them. In fact, we have a number of -- and I see this more and more with our large enterprise customers.

A good example is a large financial institution, I think in Texas, was the first one to do this, they are now actually writing into all of their new technology contracts that the solutions they're buying must be pre-integrated to Okta. So what you're getting is not only the existing technology vendors know that they need to partner, but the next generation of security vendors are coming to us and saying clearly, you are the new identity standard, the single identity platform, it's foundational, we want to make sure we're pre-integrated to it and you really see that flywheel spinning, which I think is going to be very exciting for customer success in the times ahead.

Operator

Next, we’ll hear from Richard Davis with CG Financial.

Richard Davis

Hi. Thanks. So maybe I'll take a remix on Sterling's question a little bit. So when do you guys think we're going to get to the point where you and maybe another modern security vendor or two will allow Chief Security Officers to save money and kind of de-provision or stop spending on security systems that -- when I talk to these guys, they're just like, we know we're over ensuring with stuff that's repetitively redundant, so to speak. Do you think there is a point where we get to that point where you can walk in and go look, it's a hard dollar ROI, you can like cut off six different things? Thanks.

Todd McKinnon

I think that it's an interesting question. From our perspective, it's about the choice, right, and it's about the choice to pick the apps, the infrastructure to the platforms, the security tools that are best for the customer. I think in some cases, that's a consolidation of spend around certain vendors, but in some cases, it's branching out into new areas for some business drive or business growth. I think in the flexibility the customers need, I think as many customers I talk to that want to consolidate and cut down on vendors, many more are branching into new areas and want to expand.

So, I think it's got to have flexibility to go out both ways, but I do think that you have to -- and I think you see this in all of the super successful companies, you have to manage something that the customer can pivot around, whether it's -- with us, it's the person and the identity, with other vendors, it's different things, but we're very confident that our strategy of being the system of record for identity is the right strategy and will give customers the flexibility to take the technology in the way it needs to be best for them.

Richard Davis

Got it. And then just a quick follow up. So look, we’ve seen identity management kind of evolve from password reset companies to multifactor to adaptive MSA. So have you guys ever said like how much penetration the -- whatever the highest part of the Maslow's hierarchy of identification is there, is it 10%, is it 5% of -- I mean, I know you're at the foothills, have you looked at that on that basis at all or not?

Todd McKinnon

I think, it's -- I don't have the numbers. I think, it's -- my impression from customers I talk to and so forth, it's -- the super sophisticated machine learning driven is very, very rare. I think most customers are trying to get things integrated and get the right security policy on the right resources. I think the promise is longer term, more autonomous, more machine learning type things that are kind of the truly adaptive for everything, but most customers just want the flexibility to connect other technology and then do policies appropriate for the right resources based on the risk level.

And I think that it's kind of -- and people know it's a good idea, the reason it's hard is because the stuff is not integrated, and one of the things we are doing is trying to bring that pre-integrated approach to it with our -- the Okta integration network and we think if we can integrate everything, we can give customers this -- basically a fighting chance to do the right policy on the right resources and that's going to make things much better in terms of ease of use for the users, but also for security.

Operator

We’ll now hear from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

Heather Bellini

Great. Thank you so much for the question. I had two for you guys. I guess the first one would be, you continue to just have a really good improvement in the net new customer count with over $100,000 in spending 90 last quarter or 100 this quarter. Is something changing in terms of the number of products that they might be purchasing upfront for the first time? Is it potentially that they're just adding -- they're doing larger deal sizes of a single product than maybe what you were seeing before? I just was wondering if you can give us some color there.

And then I had a question, I know that someone asked about some of the issues that Microsoft had over the last few months, but I was more wondering when you see headlines, like the one with Marriott last week, does that ever -- do you see breaches like that ever causing kind of a spike in deal activity or at least kind of RFPs for you guys? Thank you.

Todd McKinnon

Thanks, Heather. I’ll take the first question regarding what we're seeing in that momentum. I think it's a couple of things. First of all, obviously, we're very fortunate right in that we're addressing two large markets; workforce identity management and customer identity management. So what you see is, you see customers that can now start in either of those large two markets with any of our five different products. And as you start working with larger and larger organizations, whether they're governmental organizations or private companies, they find more and more ways to use the product, so they could start, for example, with multifactor Authentication for a customer situation and then they can find ways to deploy it internally for workforce. So, there's a lot of points where they can land and expand.

Number two, I think you're starting to see us just, there is a natural momentum between as we roll out 40 new releases a year in our Agile software development model, there is a lot more features and functions coming all the time and there are more and more advanced use cases we can help customers address. At the same time, you're starting to see larger and larger enterprises turning around and saying we are going to have a cloud-first approach.

Last week when I was in Europe, I remember meeting with a large utility a couple of years ago and they said, we're never going to have anything in the cloud. And that same utility, one of the largest utility companies in Europe, started the conversation last week with, we now have a cloud-first mandate across the business. And so, you're just seeing much larger organizations saying, we have to get on this journey to the cloud, we have to undertake a digital transformation and so the convergence of us being able to provide more solutions for them and the enterprise finding more and more ways to leverage the service, I think, is what you're starting to see drive those results.

By the way, that's the same reason that organizations like Deloitte are finding more and more interest in working with us, because obviously they are working with the largest organizations in the world. What I would say though is it’s very early. So I think that in this transformation, our best days by far are ahead of us in helping these large enterprises. We're very happy with the results we have, but I think that it's going to be very exciting in the times ahead.

And then, on the second piece regarding Marriott specifically, we can't point to anything this week where there are more inbound phone calls from organizations looking for that. Certainly, it is unfortunate whenever you read one of those headlines for those organizations, because it's a very tough position to be in. But yes, I think it highlights a couple of things. First of all, it highlights the fact that every company has to think about how they're going to modernize their technology and how they're going to prioritize security in a new way, whether you're a high-tech company, whether you are a retail company, whether you're in the hospitality industry, it applies to every organization.

Number two, I think it also highlights what we all know, which is there is a significant dearth of advanced software developers in the world, in North America and specifically in security and you can imagine that for a lot of these large companies, it's hard just to attract all of these advanced security software developers to their companies.

And then finally, identity is only now starting to become the center. People are now starting to come around to the fact that it is so critical, but it's taken a while and certainly a lot of these companies have had these resources available. So Marriott has been out there with their programs for many, many years, now it's time to modernize them. I think I would just point to what we just did with the Albertsons customer press release that went out today as well.

A very good example of a company that's been around 80 plus years, they've had loyalty and rewards programs for a long time, but they realize it's time to modernize and so they started working with us a couple of quarters ago, and today there is 30 million consumers accessing Albertsons' Safeway and all of their customer identity management resources on a weekly basis. I think those are the kinds of trends that you're going to see more and more of in the times ahead and certainly we think that we're very excited about the opportunity to help a lot of customers with those opportunities in their businesses.

Operator

Next, we’ll hear from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.

Shaul Eyal

Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on another set of strong results. I wanted to ask about some of the clients and contract announcements you've made, probably starting with Albertsons. It appears to be a sizable customer, I think you've indicated 30 million customers/users from their perspective interacting on a weekly basis. Was that a displacement, probably not, but just want to hear your thinking about it?

And also maybe talk to us, Todd or Freddie, about the process, maybe the timeframe it took from POC to PO and probably what are the other long-term opportunities you can see with this specific client? And then I have a question on the State Department contract? Thank you.

Todd McKinnon

Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the questions, Shaul. I'll start with Albertsons. So your first question was about what we displace there. I mean Albertsons, like a lot of large organizations, has been built up over the years, through M&A, right. So if you look, they have today dozens of different properties in food and drug retail. And so, as these different organizations have evolved and as Albertsons has rolled out more and more of these different brands, each of those different companies have come with their own set of infrastructure. So, in fact, there was legacy infrastructure, but not just at Albertsons proper, at Safeway and at all the other brands.

And so, what you have is this sprawl where they have many different installations, some of them might be home-grown, some might be of CA, some might be of Oracle or IBM, and so what happens is, you as an end customer, it's a bad experience for you, because you might have an Albertsons's login and a Safeway login, you don't get the value across both of them, they don't know what you're doing and then at Albertsons obviously they want one view of you. So they know where you're purchasing across all their properties, both on the web, on the mobile, physically inside the stores.

And so by transforming across all those different pieces of on-prem infrastructure, moving to a centralized cloud platform like the Okta identity cloud, putting all of those different resources inside one central database, they are using our Okta universal directory and allowing their customers to have a much more seamless experience, it's enhancing the customer experience, but it's also obviously on the back end providing Albertsons with much better visibility into what their customer is doing across all these different properties and that is the true value.

So absolutely we did displace legacy technologies, but it wasn't just one piece, it was undoubtedly many pieces that they were having a lot of trouble federating, because they've been around for 10,15, 20 years inside different data centers and they get very, very complicated.

On your second question around the time to work with the customer, I think you'll probably be pleasantly surprised, Albertsons has been a customer of ours for less than four quarters. I can go back and look exactly, but certainly I think it was since the beginning of this fiscal year where they signed up and I think that time to value is something that you really only get with a modern cloud platform. The fact that they were able to rollout 30 million customer visits on a weekly basis across all these different myriad properties, both physically, both on the web, on mobile applications and the fact they were able to do that in a matter of a couple of quarters, that's how you get this customer success.

And it's because of the foundational platform that we have in there that you start seeing they get very quick ROI, the TCO is easily understandable and very quickly they go from us helping them solve one specific problem where we become then the identity standard and we become pervasive across their entire organization and identity really becomes this foundational platform, they get a lot of comfort around and they can build on. And so that's specifically around Albertsons.

I believe you also had a question, you said a follow-up question around the State Department?

Shaul Eyal

And probably on the State Department, that comes under the federal verticals, talk to us a little bit, maybe specifically about this project, this concept, but also how do you see the opportunity on the federal vertical? And what are you guys doing to probably accelerate that? Without a doubt, I would imagine such a contract should entice and accelerate the appetite to do much more, you get the State Department, you know, these guys, they all talk to each other, you can get a great reference here and the sky could potentially be the limit hearing that in the federal vertical?

Todd McKinnon

I certainly hope that you're right, Shaul, so we're working on that every day. In the meantime, I'll give you some specific details around that. Look, I think, public sector very much like the question around partners earlier on the call, this is not something you can turn on overnight. I mean this is something we've been working on with the federal team in place, I think, for coming over three years now. It's not just at the federal level, but we do very well at state and local, and again, you see all sorts of organizations seeing these major imperatives of the journey to the cloud and how they're going to become technology companies.

I think when you think about public sector and the US State Department is one example. It's a good one, but it's just one example. Certainly the federal fiscal year ends in September, which coincides with our Q3, which is why we are not terribly surprised to see some good business from the federal sector as they wrap up their year and they look to the year ahead.

But I would highlight that we've been working on a lot of the underpinnings for our platform and to make it viable and a good, strong, viable, secure, reliable, scalable performance solution for the government agencies for a long time. For example, we have been HIPAA-compliant for quite some time. We are now already FedRAMP moderate, certified on the platform, and we also have native support for things like [indiscernible], which allows the government to use a lot of our Okta workforce products.

And then, finally, you see a lot of big initiatives that are happening inside the government. For example, they have the Modernized Government Technology Act, which establishes funds to improve federal technology. You also have the White House, which is pushing this cloud smart strategy with anything that can go to the cloud should go to the cloud. And I think these are just some of the examples of what you see and, obviously, we're very fortunate that we could help these organizations make those moves and we're very happy with the success we've had. But, again, I think the opportunity in the times ahead is very good.

Over the last couple of years, you've seen us work more and more with government agencies, organizations like the Department of Justice, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and now the State Department, so certainly we're starting to get good traction, it's important to make these customers successful, which we do, but we're very excited about the opportunity ahead. And I think it's again very early days and we're excited about what we can possibly do in this segment.

Operator

Next, we’ll hear from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.

Pat Walravens

Oh, great. Thank you very much and let me add my congratulations. Hey, Todd, can you walk us through just sort of at a high level, the steps that you're taking to make sure bad guys don't breach the Okta Network?

Todd McKinnon

Yeah, I mean, it's a big focus for us. We -- first of all, the main thing that customers -- when customers think about Okta, the main thing that they are trying to solve for is combining both ease of use for their end-users and security for their own application and services. So they see Okta as a way to make their own technology more secure and whether it's making sure that accounts our provision at the right time, making sure that the right people actually have access to the right services at the right time, making sure that there is the right amount of authentication, whether it's a single password, whether it's multifactor, whether it's a certain policy, all that makes a tremendous amount of improvement in how things are easy to use and then how things are secure.

And if they're building a customer facing site or mobile app, you're doing all that, while at the same time increasing their time to value and their productivity of their developers that they have to spend to build, I think. So obviously the foundation of all that is that, Okta service itself is secure and that's what we've hung our hat on and by investing a tremendous amount in the basic architecture, the processes and procedures, the technology reviews, the redundancy, it's something that it has to be built in from the ground up, it has to be consistently followed for years and years and years, it has to be part of the culture, it's something that is very, very hard to replicate.

And it's not only a technical thing, but it's also a communication thing and we have this conversation with customers and whether it's a customer that's learning about us for the first time or whether it's a customer that's expanding their usage with us, we're very good at talking to them about this in a very open and transparent way, so they can understand what we do, they can understand how we mitigate risk and they can understand why it's kind of hard to replicate and something that's very valuable to them as they try to transform their technology.

Operator

Next, we’ll hear from Gray Powell with Deutsche Bank.

Gray Powell

Thanks. Yeah. I’ll be quick. So definitely it seems like you all seeing an uptick in the adoption of MFA this year. Just ballpark, where do you think overall industry adoption is or what stage you think it's in? And then, how do you feel about the growth of the product set over the next 12 months versus the last 12? Thanks.

Todd McKinnon

I think multifactor authentication is, the stage it is, as everyone knows, it's a good idea. I think it's still too hard to rollout in general. I think we're trying to make it easier by making it pre-integrated by connecting into our policy engine, by delivering as a cloud solution. So, we're getting better, but I think there's a lot of -- the industry, as a whole, has to move from everyone knows it's a good idea to having a kind of this broadly deployed multifactor connected to policy engine and we're trying to help.

I think product innovation is critical to us and we're very excited about what's ahead for us in terms of product innovation in releasing new capabilities and we are going to have -- I encourage everyone to stay tuned, we have a customer conference coming up in just three and a half months, a lot of time for announcements there.

Operator

We’ll now hear from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.

Jonathan Ho

Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to start out with, maybe the international opportunity and maybe where you see the most opportunity to leverage investments as well as maybe how the challenges differ in the international markets?

Todd McKinnon

Yeah, sure. Hi, Jonathan. Nice to hear from you. Happy to tell a little bit about that. I think the first thing is, we're very excited about the opportunity in international and I think that you're starting to see the results speak for themselves. That business is growing and it's growing fast. I think there's a lot of opportunity in terms of not only the customer interest for what we do, but also in working with a lot of these channel partners, because those markets are much more fragmented, obviously you have dozens of countries in Europe, Asia Pacific is the same.

And so to the question about partners that we had earlier, one of the things that we've spent a lot of time on over the last 12, 24 months, is really making sure that we have the right partner programs with the right incentives making it very easy for our partners to adopt our products and help distribute them in the market. I think you're going to see more and more of that. We've also historically made the right investments ahead of time that I think are now bearing fruit.

So, for example, we have had data centers in Europe where they can sell over data to a second data center in Europe without ever coming to North America, that's a solution that's been out there for quite some time. We're in the process of implementing the same in Asia Pacific to, again, give customers the comfort that they can keep their data in region if they're interested and, again, with very high levels of control, security, reliability, availability and I think some of those things are very important.

At the same time, you've also seen us continue to invest in expansion of our offices. Our office in London has continued to grow over the last four or five years, and we've continued to take on more office space there with opportunity. I mentioned that we opened formally our Paris office last week. We've had an office in Sydney for some time and we're continuing to invest there. So I think the opportunities in international are early, they are exciting, they're big and there are huge opportunities for us in the years ahead.

Operator

Our final question will come from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Rob Owens

Good afternoon, guys. Want to drill down a little bit into the international financial services win, both on the workforce ID side and the customer ID side, just relatively where do you get more dollars? Is it on the workforce side or the customer side as you see some of these guys bite on both sides of the apple?

Todd McKinnon

Yeah. Happy to talk about that, Rob. I think one thing we should talk about is what's happening today. And then I think we should talk about the trends and what we see happening in the future. Look, today, and as evidenced by our business, we started with Workforce Identity Management. So at first, we're coming up on wrapping up our 10th year business, which is great. Our first five years of business, we basically only had our Workforce Identity Management product.

Now why is that? Well, Workforce Identity, formerly known as Enterprise Identity, is something that's well known. It's been in the industry for 20, 25 years, legacy software vendors Oracle, IBM, CA have had solutions here for the days of homogeneity when you are in IBM shop or an Oracle shop. And so, it was a well understood kind of need as we came into the market. So if you look at our first thousand customers, all they could buy actually was Workforce Identity.

Now that's great and that's going to continue to grow and that's a big market and we're barely scratching the surface and you're going to see more and more workforce identity business in the years ahead. What's happened over the last few years is, our customers have started to say, hey, I've built this customer identity management infrastructure myself in the past, it's getting complicated. We talked about examples like Marriott.

Security is important, password reset flows, registration across devices, multiple e-mail addresses, these are very complex pieces of technology for companies to build themselves, so they have started using solutions like what we have in the customer identity and access management in the Okta identity cloud. So, it is a newer part of our business, right, also growing very quickly. But what's exciting is in the times ahead, if you think about a large organization like Dignity Health, which is a customer of ours, we can help them with their workforce, obviously, which is tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of employees in certain cases.

We haven't set our products. They are very well suited, there is a lot of use cases for them, but in -- on the customer identity side, as they put more and more online, as they digitize more and more of their business, there is more and more constituents that at organization like Dignity Health needs to interact with.

For example, they could have patient portals that you and I go and pay our bills on, they could have physician portals where physicians come and get information on patients, they could have vendor or a supplier portals where they talk about their supply chain. So whereas an organization could have one large workforce opportunity for us to help them with, they could start to develop more and more of these customer identity management opportunities as well. And that's why I think you see that people are -- have very good ideas on how large the market is for workforce, which is very large and they're starting to develop those ideas around customer identity management.

So that's a longwinded way of saying, today, customers can land with either a workforce or customer identity with either of our five products. They find ways to crosssell and upsell themselves, because of our very high customer dollar based net retention rate of 120%. But in the times ahead, I think it's a toss-up on which of these two large markets are going to continue to grow faster, lot of opportunity, and obviously we want to be there to help the customers with either one. I mean, it's certainly something that we're going to continue to keep an eye on it in the times ahead.

Operator

That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Todd McKinnon for any additional or closing remarks.

Todd McKinnon

So, we appreciate the time today. We are excited about our progress this year and, but the most exciting thing for us, I think, is that, we're still very early in these big trends where this trend of cloud adoption, we've been talking about it for a long time, but when you look at organizations around the world, where the large companies, governments, international markets, cloud is a big transformation that's going to take many, many years ahead and we're going to be there to help customers along the way.

Same with digital transformation, that's a continuously evolving thing and we're very excited that identity is the core of that and it's going to be a growth driver for years ahead. And, finally, security is just timeless. So, while we're excited about the results, we're more excited about the future potential and working hard every day to make sure we capitalize on this. So, thank you very much for your time and we look forward to seeing you on the road or talking to you in the next quarterly call.

Tom Reilly

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2019 financial performance. I recognize today is very special, the national day of mourning for President Bush. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family and the nation. Considering the markets are closed today, in honor of this special memory, I appreciate all of you joining us for this call.

I will quickly review Q3 results Cloudera standalone and then update you on our proposed merger with Hortonworks, our combined company strategy, and the progress we're making in integration planning.

Remember that the transaction was announced on October 3 in the midst of our third quarter. Despite this major development and all the groundwork we had to lay for the merger, we remained focused and executed well to deliver strong results in the quarter.

Total revenue for the third quarter was $118 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25%. Subscription software revenue grew 28% year-over-year. Recall that we are very focused on driving expansions at our existing customers and acquiring new customers in our target market. The sum of existing customers graduating to greater than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue and new customers beginning with annual recurring revenue above $100,000 is our measure of new business activity. We increased this number by 33 in the quarter for a total of 601 customers with more than $100,000 of ARR at the conclusion of Q3. Reflecting the significance of this measure, these 601 customers represented more than 90% of software revenue in the quarter.

While much of our focus is on long-term strategy and merger planning, it is reassuring to see continued favorable results from the go-to-market changes we initiated a few quarters ago. We added 63 new customers in Q3, predominantly in our target market. Increasingly, our new customer wins are being driven by our hybrid cloud offerings. We've noted from customer engagements the past few quarters that there is little interest in a public cloud versus on-premises deployment debate. Instead, the hybrid cloud and avoidance of cloud lock-in themes are amplified. Customers are demanding hybrid and multi-cloud capability, and our competitive advantages here are evident in their decision making.

Reinforcing our hybrid cloud strategy, even our partner AWS announced an on-premises appliance [ph] last week to drive -- to address the hybrid cloud expectations of large enterprises. Given our years of investment in both hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities, we have a strong competitive advantage in this rapidly evolving market.

Furthermore, the customer wins in our target market reinforce our field and go-to-market transformation efforts initiated earlier this year to drive strong net expansion rates. Existing customers continue to renew and expand, contributing to an expansion rate for Q3 of 127%. Workloads in the cloud as measured by instance hours are outpacing this growth. In all, we are pleased with our execution in the quarter.

Of course, the big news in Q3 was our announced plan to merge with Hortonworks. Each day, we get more excited to bring these complementary businesses together. Having received early termination of the antitrust waiting period and having filed our joint proxy statement with Hortonworks, we and Hortonworks plan to hold our respective shareholder meetings to vote on the proposed merger later this month with the completion of the merger to follow soon thereafter. If the closing occurs as planned, we'll complete the transaction ahead of schedule in less than 90 days.

I will now spend a few moments to review the strategic rationale for the combination and update you on our progress with respect to integration planning. As you can see in our S-4 registration statement, this is a transaction that Rob Bearden, CEO of Hortonworks, and I’ve been considering discussing for several years now. It is a natural alignment and it’s always made great business sense. The deal is highly strategic and will position the combined company for enhanced innovation, market expansion, and sustained long-term growth. It is about achieving the scale needed to compete with a new class of competitors and to service the ever-changing needs of some of the world's most demanding organizations. As a combined company, powered by open source innovation, we'll have the scale and the skills required for market leadership and to capture market growth.

To keep things simple, you can think about the merger rationale in two broad buckets. The first is innovation and growth, and the second is market leadership and financial synergies.

Let's talk innovation and growth. The combination of Cloudera and Hortonworks will fuel innovation at a greater rate and pace than we could have achieved as standalone companies. The new Cloudera will have the scale, resources, and talent to do more and do it faster. Our significant investments in engineers and committers to work with the open source community will enable us to innovate on key technologies ranging from real time streaming at the edge to an enterprise grade cloud native data warehouse and a new platform to industrialize AI, all delivering the industry's first enterprise data cloud.

The enterprise data cloud is the embodiment of our shared, cloud everywhere vision. Together, we plan to accelerate our cloud competitiveness and innovation, delivering the only data and analytics offering that is both hybrid and multi-cloud, supporting all five major public cloud vendors; AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, and Oracle. We aim to bring the right data analytics to data anywhere the enterprise needs to work.

The emergence of new open source standards, including Kubernetes and container technology, will play a significant role in the strategy, enabling the separation of computing storage and cloud-like architectures that customers can run anywhere. In fact, earlier today, at the AI Summit, we announced the preview of our next generation cloud native machine learning platform, powered by Kubernetes. Cloudera Machine Learning will deliver fast provisioning and auto scaling as well as containerized, distributed processing across multiple cloud environments.

As one company, we will also spark new growth by investing in a unified platform that spans the edge to AI, broadening the breadth of use cases we support in expanding the markets we serve. We’ll blend the strongest elements of each company's technology in this new platform and cross-sell the products that have represented competitive advantage for our respective companies.

In recent years, we have each invested in differentiated yet complementary areas. Hortonworks has invested in real time streaming and data ingest to support IoT use cases at the edge. Likewise, Cloudera has invested heavily in machine learning and AI to empower data scientists with the state of art tooling to automate machine learning workflows. The new Cloudera will become the only player to offer a complete solution from the edge to AI, increasingly use cases enable, expanding our addressable market and then locking great cross-sell opportunities.

Specifically, soon after our merger, we plan to sell Hortonworks edge offering, HDF, or Hortonworks DataFlow, to existing Cloudera customers. We plan to sell Cloudera Data Science Workbench to existing Hortonworks customers. These are the first and many cross-sell opportunities we have identified.

Okay. Now, let’s discuss bucket number two, market leadership and financial synergies. The combination of Cloudera and Hortonworks creates a clear market leader in industry standard for a modern data platform, producing significant advantages for customers and partners. Establishing the industry standard minimizes risk and improves clarity for customers. It simplifies customers’ evaluation processes and speeds decision making. The standard also focuses the open source communities’ innovative efforts.

In terms of the partner ecosystem, a standard streamlines go-to-market and development efforts. Partners have had a split resources and focus between our two platforms. Now, our partners will be able to commit more resources to the relationship and concentrate their investments in a unified platform. For example, we expect to enhance and expand our partnerships with the public cloud providers as we bring more enterprise customers with production workloads to their platforms.

Last but certainly not least, significant financial synergies produced by merging the two companies. We expect to generate substantially more cash in a shorter timeframe than if we have remained independent companies. We will also accelerate achievement of our long-term target model. Although the merger will generate large cost savings, it is important to note that we intend to invest some of those savings into enhanced go-to-market capabilities and the technological innovations mentioned previously.

So, in summary, the merger will deliver accelerated innovation growth and established clear market leadership. The strategic merit and financial benefits are apparent. While merging two companies is hard work, it has been really encouraging to have our plans validated by countless customers and partners since announcing the merger. This outpouring of support from our respective customers and partners reinforces the industrial logic of the merger. It also makes Rob and I wish we had found a way to join forces sooner. Perhaps the greatest area of enthusiasm has been around our new product roadmap. Customers love the idea of an enterprise data cloud that supports both hybrid and multi-cloud implementations with use cases that span from the edge to AI.

They also appreciate that much of our software from the two companies is common open source and also complementary code, thereby making our job as integrating the two platforms easier and less risky. Our customers also appreciate the glide path that we've created for them. And to-date we've seen no change in purchasing habits. As most of you are aware, Cloudera and Hortonworks are prohibited from operating as one company until the merger is closed. However, during this pre-closing period, we have made tremendous progress in planning post-merger integration, and many of our critical integration decisions have been made. We have consultants from top professional services firms, helping us get the planning and execution right. We also have a joint steering committee, integration management office and functional integration teams dedicated to merger integration.

My sincere thanks to all the individuals from both Hortonworks and Cloudera for their cooperation and commitment to achieving our shared vision for the new company.

Our merger integration teams are working extremely well together and are ahead of schedule. Here's a quick update on some of the concrete steps we’re taking in a pre-close merger, integration planning. Every business function has created their integration plans. This will enable a fast start to capturing the expected merger benefits.

The engineering and product teams have already agreed on our joint product vision and roadmap. We have independently completed the engineering works to ensure that soon after the merger closes, Cloudera Data Science Workbench, and Hortonworks DataFlow offerings will function with each other's platforms and can be cross-sold.

We have validated our specific cost synergy assumptions by functional area, and believe that we have identified the potential for even greater synergy than assumed, which we intend to reinvest in high growth areas including Hybrid Cloud, Machine Learning, IoT and Edge.

I could not be more pleased by the substantial work that has been done to date and the reception that our plan is receiving the market from our partner network. After working on integration planning for more than 60 days, so ultimately, [ph] is that our companies are more similar than we had appreciated.

Culturally, we share the same commitment to open source software, innovation and customer success. As we've highlighted in the past, our product roadmap and technology vision for the future are nearly identical.

Our go-to-market strategies, sales, channel and partnerships are the same. We are impressed at how well aligned we are already. We target similar customers with similar technology in a similar way. The things that differentiate us are mostly relative strengths that we want to preserve in the combined company for competitive advantage and customer benefit.

And on the practical front, integration is aided by both companies being headquartered in Silicon Valley and each was having development and support centers in both Hungary and India. This makes integration easier and increase the ability to capture more surgeries earlier. As the customers, we have very little overlap among our combined customer base with fewer than 5% of all customers in common.

This is enlarges t our opportunity, reduces the potential for disruption and sales motion and simplifies the assignments of account executives.

On the whole, we are happy with the integration planning and particularly feedback on our plans from ecosystem customers, partners and developers. To make sure there's plenty of work to do, but the challenges with integration that technology companies typically face are less apparent here.

Now, I'd like to ask Jim to provide more detailed on financial update. Please, Jim.

Jim Frankola

Thanks, Tom. Hello, everyone.

Across the board, we had another good quarter in Q3. Subscription software revenue was $100 million for the third quarter, an increase of 28% year-over-year. In total, revenue was $118 million for the third quarter, representing 25% growth over a year-ago period. Given that our merger announcement occurred mid-quarter, we are very satisfied with our execution in the face of this news.

Some highlights this past quarter, we increased by 33 in number of customers who started at or have grown to more than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue, bringing the total to 601 customers in this class. As of Q3, we had 74 customers with more than $1 million ARR, representing 52% of software revenue.

Finally, our net expansion rate in Q3 held relatively steady at 127%. Collectively, these measures reflect our ability to both acquire target customers and advance customers along a journey toward increasingly attractive unit economics. As I review the remainder of the income statement, note that unless otherwise stated, all references to expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis. Historical non-GAAP results are reconciled to GAAP results in the press release issued earlier today.

Cloudera’s continued focus on operational efficiency was reflected in Q3 results as margins and expenses improved in nearly every respect. In particular, expenses were much better than expected. In anticipation of the leverage that the merger provides, we slowed hiring in areas that will be impacted by the merger and have gotten a fast start on achieving our cost savings target. Total gross margin for Q3 was 79% compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This is driven by subscription gross margin of 89%, up from 86% a year ago.

As to operating expenses, sales and marketing expense was $49 million for the third quarter or 42% of total revenue. This compares to 57% of total revenue in the year-ago period. Research and development was $30 million for the third quarter or 25% of total revenue, improved from 31% a year ago. G&A was $18 million for the third quarter or 15% of total revenue versus 12% of total revenue in Q3 of last year. This increase was driven by $6 million of merger-related costs. Excluding these costs, G&A would have been 10% of revenue, better than a year-ago.

Overall, operating loss was $4 million in Q3, representing a negative operating margin of 3%. This was a substantial improvement of more than 22 percentage points compared to the year ago period. Loss per share was $0.03 in the third quarter, based on 152 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to a loss for share of $0.17 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Please review the financial statements tables in today’s press release for additional information regarding historical and forward-looking stock-based compensation expense and shares outstanding.

Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We exited Q3 with $453 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was negative $7 million which includes $6 million of merger-related spending. Cash flow performance was better than expected due to strong collections and early achievement of the merger-related savings. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was negative $6 million compared to negative $20 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. These results have us on track to meet our standalone company goals of being operating cash flow positive in Q1 of 2020 and for the full fiscal year 2020.

Capital expenditures were $2 million in the quarter. Total deferred revenue was $277 million at the end of the third quarter, up 19% year-over-year. Short-term deferred revenue was $243 million, up 23% year-over-year.

I will conclude by providing initial guidance for fiscal Q4 and updated guidance for fiscal 2019. Note that the guidance is provided for Cloudera on a standalone basis. We intend to provide guidance for the combined company after closing the merger and completion of Cloudera's fiscal fourth quarter.

We expect Q4 total revenue to be between $119 million and $120 million, representing approximately 17% growth compared to Q4 last year with subscription software revenue in the range of $101 million to $103 million, up approximately 21% year-over-year. Net loss per share its projected to be $0.12 to $0.10 based on 155 million weighted average shares outstanding.

For the fiscal year 2019, we expect total revenue to be between $450 million and $453 million, representing approximately 23% growth compared to fiscal year 2018 with subscription software revenue in the range of $380 million to $382 million, up approximately 20% -- sorry, up approximately 27% year-over-year. Net loss per share is projected to be $0.40 to $0.38 based on 151 million weighted average shares outstanding. We expect operating cash flow for this year to be negative $25 million to negative $20 million. Note that operating cash flow projections for fiscal 2019 include approximately $12 million of Q3 and Q4 expenses related to the announcement of and planning for the merger. Upon closing of the merger, there will be additional costs, which may be incurred as early as January 2019. These additional costs have not been included in our operating cash flow forecast for fiscal 2019.

To summarize, not only did we execute well on our standalone business, but we made a surprising amount of progress on the merger. By limiting hiring to areas that directly support growth, we have achieved more than 20% of merger synergies before the deal has closed. This combination of solid execution and focused hiring is driving our finance results for the year.

With that I'll turn -- return the call to Tom for some concluding remarks.

Tom Reilly

Thank you, Jim. Just a few thoughts before we take questions. We're really pleased with execution in Q3 and more importantly, in a strategic combination that we've announced with Hortonworks. Planning and pre-closing merger-integration work is going very well. All of us are encouraged by how the combined company will position in the next generation data management market. As one company, we will provide a comprehensive solution set for customers from the edge to AI, and accelerate our momentum in cloud innovation.

I'm sure, there may be tip note of IBM’s announced acquisition of Red Hat. Of course, the move by IBM underscores the importance of open source software as strategic data center technology. But the real significance of the deal from an industry point of view is its reinforcement of the macro trend towards hybrid and private cloud environments. This is the enterprise data cloud concept, a public cloud experience at the edge, in the data center, in private cloud, on-premises and of course across multiple public clouds, cloud everywhere. I’m especially looking forward to leveraging Hortonworks’ strategic partnership with IBM to take advantage of their Red Hat investments.

As soon as our merger closes, we will be the only next generation data management company to run across all major public cloud infrastructure. Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google, IBM and Oracle. We believe that operating across all clouds while also offering a public cloud experience everywhere, what we call the enterprise data cloud, is a powerful competitive advantage because it is what enterprises expect.

The team and I are grateful to our customers, our employees, our developer community, our partners, and of course to our investors. Thank you all for joining us on this special day. Operator, this is a great time for us to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.

Tyler Radke

Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. My first question, I was just hoping you could walk us through the outlook for Q4, especially as I look at net expansion rates, which came in at a 127%, which is pretty strong. And it looks like you're adding a healthy amount of new customers as well. So, I'm just curious why revenue growth would be below 20% in 2019 or subscription revenue growth I guess is around 21%? It just seems like the combination of customer additions and mid-to-high 20s net expansion rate would support higher growth.

Jim Frankola

Yes. Thanks, Tyler. This is Jim. Recall that net expansion rate is a lagging measure and that we initiated a go-to-market transformation earlier this year. So, we anticipated disruption in the first part of the year in bookings which we saw. It takes a while for those -- that disruption in bookings to be reflected in revenue. So, what you have reflected in our Q4 revenue guidance is the result of the transactions that we did in the first part of the year. It's basically that simple.

Tyler Radke

Okay. And I guess, where would you expect those to trough out? I think you originally said in the low 120s. Is that still your expectation?

Jim Frankola

Yes. That’s still the expectation. Once again, when you look at net expansion rate, it's helpful to look in an annual context. So, our guide for revenue for the year is 27% growth in software revenue, which is actually I think about 3 percentage points higher than our initial guidance for the year. So, the year has turned out to be better than we initially expected. So, of those 27 percentage points of growth, let's call roughly 5, 6 percentage points will come from new customers added over the course a year. So, therefore, call it, some number in the low 20s, 20, 21, 22, will come from our existing customers. And it's not a perfect correlation between that number and net expansion rate, but it's pretty good. So, that's the guidance that we gave earlier in the year. That's where we are today. I think, early in the year, I was expecting net expansion rate to trough out in the high 1 teens, like 118, 119. Obviously, it looks like it will be a little bit better than that.

Tyler Radke

Great. And then, if I could sneak one more in. Maybe just so as you think about heading into FY20, obviously you will be a combined company. But, just how you're thinking about execution and kind of return to growth now that you have the strategy laid out and the new Head of Sales and everything?

Tom Reilly

Tyler, this is Tom. I'll start with that and Jim might have further thoughts. So, one, I'm very pleased with our new Head of Sales, who has joined Cloudera. I'm excited that we are early in identifying revenue synergies from the merger. Those will come from immediately on almost day one, our cross-sell capabilities, we mentioned a couple during the call. We've already identified some that can follow in the subsequent quarters. And then the innovation that we're going to drive, especially around our enterprise data cloud strategy is going to be a strong differentiator. We think the market is moving towards us from it just being a public cloud versus on-premise to enterprises realizing that they want a hybrid multi-cloud strategy. So, all of this gives me great confidence that we see continued strong growth.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives from Wedbush. Your line is open.

Daniel Ives

Just to confirm, just you’re maintaining your targets on the combined company you gave when you announced the deal? Because I’m getting a few questions from investors, just to confirm.

Jim Frankola

I'm not sure I heard the question. If the question is when will we be releasing guidance and updating our model for the combined company, it will not be until we obviously close the transaction and close our Q4 business, because obviously Q4 is by far the biggest quarter of our year. That is what will allow us to set the guidance for fiscal year ‘20. So, we'll do it after our Q4 results are in.

Daniel Ives

Okay. And just the last question. So, you're maintaining the targets that you’d be on the combined company when you announced the deal, I just want to confirm that?

Jim Frankola

Yes. So, let me start with that and then I’ll let Tom take over. When we announced the deal, what I'll say is, we didn't issue guidance or targets. We wanted to describe what the profile of the company would look like. And as a combined entity, in fiscal year ‘21 or calendar year ‘20, we said that we would be more than $1 billion of revenue, growing faster than 20% a year with more than a 15% operating cash flow margin. There are literally only a handful of enterprise companies that fit that profile, and the companies that fit that profile are attacking large markets with disruptive technology and are well-managed.

Now, that does not mean we’re guiding to $1 billion of revenue, we're guiding to more than $1 billion of revenue. Exactly what that's going to be, we’ll have much better insight but then we’d need to close Q4. I need to understand how much of a deferred revenue haircut we will be taking on the Hortonworks revenue. So, don't take that as a guidance, take that as a profile of the type of company we will be.

Daniel Ives

Thanks for the clarity.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.

Michael Turits

Hey, guys. Good evening. It looks like very strong numbers in all respects. The billings number, Jim, I know not your favorite, was a growth rate of about 16% in the short-term, I calculated around 10%. So, you commented that bookings were weaker in the first half of the year. Are bookings still weak and should I think that 16% as more like a bookings number? And the broader context in which I ask that is what’s going on in terms of demand for on-premise, Hadoop? And as you probably know, another data management company talked about deceleration is on-premise, Hadoop demand to less than 20% this year and flat bookings next year. So, I was wondering if you could, as I said, comment on that mid teens billings number, and should we be concerned that that's an indication that that other companies thoughts about on-premise, Hadoop deceleration are correct?

Jim Frankola

Yes. We're going to break that question up in two pieces. What I’ll say is -- I am not going get on my fill box on billings, other than to say, it’s not a great measure on a quarterly basis. If you were to look at our trailing 12 months total billings, they’re up, I think about 80% year-over-year. We are seeing shorter contract durations and more importantly shorter billings durations. So, in fiscal year ‘17 and ‘18, our average billing duration was a little bit over 14 months; in Q3, it was 13 months. So, we’re getting closer and closer to upfront annual payment terms. So, that will be a drag on billings growth relative to bookings and revenue growth. But, then, with that said, If you compare that 18% growth in billings on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to our revenue guidance in Q4, compared to our growth in deferred revenue, short-term deferred revenue, all those numbers converge in roughly around 20. So, what you’re seeing here is a business that is positioned to grow roughly 20%, a little bit faster than on software come Q4. And clearly post Q4 is where we’re looking to see the benefits on a standalone basis of the go-to-market transition. And then, obviously, we’re going to accelerate that with the merger with Hortonworks. I’ll turn over it to Tom talk about the second part of your question.

Tom Reilly

Michael, good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. And I know that another Michael, a CEO of one of our peer companies, made some comments about on-premises Hadoop slowing down. I don’t want to disagree with him. There’s some validity to what he says. But here’s a couple things I’d like to share with you. First off, we don’t view ourselves as an on-premise Hadoop customer -- or provider. Our capabilities have gone way beyond what it was traditionally called Hadoop. Our value proposition is managing data across multiple data stores, including cloud storage buckets and on-premise environments. And we do see traditional bare metal deployment slowing down, because customers want to move workloads to private cloud and public cloud, what we call the enterprise data cloud, and we are capturing those workloads.

So, as I said, the discussion no longer is it bare metal on-premise, our customers want cloud capabilities. And they want that cloud capabilities in most areas. They want it in the private cloud, and they want it across multiple public cloud players. No longer they just -- they want to avoid cloud lock-in, they’re not betting on just one public cloud provider. And Cloudera is in a very unique competitive position to capture the market growth where the market is headed. So, I hope that provides some clarity on the other Michael’s comments in his earnings call.

Michael Turits

Great. Thanks, Tom and Jim. I guess my follow-up in the same line of question. So, Jim, you just basically 20% of real economic growth in the fourth quarter. You’ve said over 20% growth combined companies in fiscal ‘20. You haven’t talked about the intervening years yet. But, I’d say, let’s just say, since the guide of over 20% that you gave on the merger call, and given some of those inputs that -- from that other management company in the quarters trend, any diminution at all in your confidence in those kinds of growth profiles?

Jim Frankola

I mean, from my standpoint, everything that I see, gives us conference -- I'll back it up for our long-term. Way back in -- we went through IPO, we noted that our net expansion rates in our customer set range between 120 and 150. And where we are today, we’re still above 120. More importantly, when we look at our target customer set, the G2K and companies like that, their net expansion rates continue to be well above that 120. So, as we are executing this go-to market transformation of which part of it is a refined target market, I see that as something that's going to help our net expansion rates over time. Clearly, everything that we see happening with the merger with Hortonworks, the ability to cross-sell product, I don’t need to go through the whole pinch of innovation and cloud and so forth. All of that will be a tailwind for positive growth in net expansion rates.

Now, we don't know exactly how much it will be. We also understand as we execute the merger for the first few months we got to bring two companies together. That's why we want to get past the merger close, get Q4 results under our belt before we give more guidance on both fiscal year ‘20 as well as the longer term business model, which I think would include fiscal year ‘21.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open.

Jack Andrews

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could rank order, either in terms of specific partner names or maybe just categories or partners. Who's most excited about this merger and maybe who has the most questions around it?

Tom Reilly

This is Tom. Good question, Jack. I haven’t thought it like in the rank order. But, let me go through who -- for most part, all partners are very excited. So, each of Hortonworks and Cloudera had over 3,000 partners in our programs, and they were complete overlap, say for two partners. And so, when you talk to the GSIs, they're very ecstatic because the GSIs have to invest skills, they have to train their teams, they're building solutions on top of the platforms. So, they like seeing industry standard emerge and have one platform I think they write to and it satisfies all the customers that they talk to.

The next one are the ISVs. So, we at Cloudera over 500 ISVs in our program. These ISVs all have to integrate their software to two platforms today. Quickly next year and as we deliver our first combined platform, they only have to integrate to one platform. That's going to make those integrations tighter. Now, customers benefit from both those things, SIs with better skills and deeper domain on one platform and ISVs that have done a better job of integrating.

Finally, we have been -- both Hortonworks and Cloudera have had a focus of bringing large enterprise customers in their workloads to the cloud platform, to public cloud platforms. In particular today, Amazon, Microsoft and to a degree Google, these partners have all expressed excitement about our merger because they too don't have to spread their time between two firms, two different sales forces that are competing. They want to put their energy behind us and help accelerate those migrations to their platforms as well.

And then, finally, I've always been envious of the work that Hortonworks has done with IBM. I'm pleased that IBM is very excited about this partnership. And we are going to embrace that partnership and take it to the next level. And finally, I certainly believe that my colleagues at Hortonworks are excited about the relationship with Intel and the strategic work that we've been doing there. But I can attest that Intel is also very excited about this merger because it helps them get more optimization upstream towards for their platform. So, Jack, I can't identified any partners to date that have expressed concerns, nor have I come across any customers that have expressed concerns. In fact, we're almost receiving lots of great momentum and support to bring two companies together.

Jack Andrews

Okay. I really appreciate that detail. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, Tom. I was wondering if you could drill down on the impact of this merger as it relates to the strategy you got lined at your Analyst Day, which was specifically around taking market share in the data warehouse segment, whether that kind of strategy is still intact in terms of the combined company or how you're thinking about what that particular initiative that you outlined several months ago?

Tom Reilly

Thank you, Jack. That strategy and initiative is alive, well, and growing extremely well. So, basically, SQL, capabilities on our platform are maturing very rapidly and customers are moving increasingly more workloads from traditional data warehouses to this platform. Our Altus Data Warehouse is particularly designed to capture these migrations that want to move to the cloud where you see a company like Snowflake or Amazon Redshift traditionally serving those cloud markets. But, we have strong competitive advantages in data warehousing. So, first and foremost, we offer the only data warehouse that combines both SQL and machine learning against the shared data experience, none of the other players are doing that today.

Secondly, we offer it in a hybrid fashion. We can do it both on-premise or in the public cloud and increasingly you want to do both if you're managing a migration. So, that's very powerful. And then, we can get technical, but we have years and years of experience of doing this at great scale. And so, we're bringing those years of experience to bear. We believe data warehouse workloads are naturally going to land on our platform, and we're well positioned to capture those.

Your next question comes from the line of Chad Bennett from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.

Chad Bennett

Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Real quick probably for Jim. Jim, I think last quarter you talked about or at least gave a metric around initial deal sizes, considering the change in the go-to-market. Any update there? I guess, I didn't hear it this quarter.

Jim Frankola

This quarter, our initial deal size was much closer to historical average. As you'd expect that tends to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. We tend to want to focus on customers that ran at high -- greater than $100,000 of ARR or expand more than 100,000 of ARR. That's really our measure of a true new customer and engagement. Once again, this quarter, we did 33, up from 30 last quarter; we're pleased with our progress in landing and expanding customers at that greater than $100,000 level.

Chad Bennett

Okay. And then, for Tom, going back to the merger targets for 2020, if I'm hearing you correctly on your kind of pre-close integration execution here, revenue synergies, you believe you're already seeing or -- in terms of potential, and you've made headway in terms of HDF being capable to the Cloudera base and Data Science Workbench to that Hortonworks space. I don't believe revenue synergies were factored in that 1 billion plus or any meaningful revenue synergies in that 1 billion plus target. And then, secondly, you talked about financial cost synergies, so to speak, being ahead of plan, albeit you likely will reinvest that. So, I just want to make sure, in light of what you said on October 3rd to what you’re saying today, it seems to me that not only is that 2020 framework solid, but you potentially are ahead of the game there. Am I characterizing it correct?

Tom Reilly

Chad, I think there’s a lot to what you’re saying. It is true that our business case had no revenue synergies assumed. In fact, there are some energies expected. But, I will tell you, I am encouraged as how our teams are coming together. I’m encouraged of the little bit of a small overlap between our customer basis. I am encouraged by the fact that because we both have our platforms in open source, each for our teams, independently we’re able to test our cross sell opportunities now and get them ready for early -- since we announced this merger and close it. We’re going to show up at each our respective customers and give them capability that didn’t exist pre-close. So, I’m very encouraged.

I’m not in a position to say are there -- what we think was those revenue synergies are. But, I’m very encouraged with our opportunities to drive growth. And we do expect to have many more resources and opportunities to invest in growth. Our roadmap that we are laying out. At the time, we had that same -- we talked about strategy, we talked about our hybrid cloud roadmap that we were going to deliver independently. Hortonworks had a separate cloud [ph] they’re delivering. Together with the synergy we found in engineering overlap, we’re accelerating the delivery of that to the point now where we’re actually talking to customers about the capabilities that they will be receiving quite quickly. So, I’m encouraged is how I would frame it Chad. And I think by the time, Jim’s prepared after our Q4s and look at the plans to give guidance, I think, he’ll be able to deliver more accurate prediction there.

Chad Bennett

And then, just maybe one real quick, if I could. Tom, I believe you mentioned in the net new customer adds in the quarter, how well the hybrid architecture or pitch is going. Can you just provide more color on how -- I think the big trepidation here is, net new is going to kind of fall off a map, because they’re just going to bypass you and move straight to the cloud guys. Just kind of any color on how you’re winning deals and how the hybrid pitch is resonating, more details?

Tom Reilly

Chad, I’ll be -- let me get specific to help you here. So, what I said in my prepared remarks is the market is moving in our direction. If you look two years ago, enterprises were trying to figure out what this public cloud thing was. And they were spending time with the AWSs of world understanding those platforms and going right to public cloud. Large enterprises have moved to the public cloud just two years ago are wanting to move off public cloud. They do not like the cost, they do not like the lock-in that it poses; they certainly are stuck with one public cloud provider, all that they have to offer.

And so, they’re moving workloads back into private cloud or across multiple clouds to avoid that lock-in and have leverage over those infrastructure costs. When we hear from customers, public cloud is just the new hardware for them. If a complete stack was going to win the market, then Oracle plus Sun would have won long time ago in a data center. It’s not what customers want. They want the flexibility and they want this hybrid enterprise cloud capability.

Now, I'll talk, in the quarter, we won 63 new customers. Customers are coming to our platform, all of them are evaluating cloud, and it's our hybrid cloud capabilities are winning. Here's -- I'll give you the caliber of some names that we’re allowed to share. Indonesia's largest motorcycle manufacturer Astra’s Honda Motor, selected us for our cloud capabilities. Tufts Health Plan selected us in a competitive battle for our cloud capabilities. Mizuho Securities, here in the USA, a very conservative company, selected us for our cloud capabilities. In Michigan with our largest utility DTE Energy selected us for our cloud capabilities. These are new wins. I’ve got an equally long list of existing large enterprise customers that moved workloads to the cloud with Cloudera. And so, it is -- we are uniquely positioned to run where our customers want to run and give them a lot of flexibility.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Karl Keirstead

Thank you. Maybe this question is for Jim. Jim, one of the takes from this calls for me anyway is that it feels like the costs of synergies are being realized faster than at least I expected. And so, I just wanted to return to your initial target for $125 million in annual cost synergies in calendar ‘19 or fiscal ‘20. Initially, when you gave that number, I would have assumed that perhaps in terms of the weighting first half ’19, second half ‘19, the cost synergies might be a little bit more weighted to the second half as it takes some time to execute on them. But, given the pace at which you are realizing these cost synergies, I'm now wondering whether those savings might land a little bit more in the first half. Any thoughts on how they'll be realized throughout the year, given the outperformance this past quarter? Thank you.

Jim Frankola

Yes. So, Karl, since I didn’t give any guidance on the quarter utilization [ph] of that, I'm not going to update my lack of guidance. What I will do is, is say that directionally what you're hearing from us is that as we've gotten into the merger planning, I’ll echo some of Tom’s comments, we are more alike than dissimilar, as one of the executives who's actively engaged in this process on a daily basis, the teams are working extremely well together. They are planning with the idea of the combined entity and optimizing for it. And because of that, decisions on our overall being made faster than what I've seen in the past. And I've done big acquisitions at IBM, I've done mergers of equals before in software companies. By far, this is going faster and better than anything I've ever been associated with. So, yes, whatever savings that you probably were assuming that we would get, we're probably going to get a little bit faster because so far the merger planning process is going extremely well. We're not done. There's always the chance for surprise, but we really like what we see so far.

Operator

Your next question comes from a line Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Unidentified Analyst

Hi, guys. This is actually, Hannah [ph] on for Rishi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could comment on the international traction you've seen this quarter, and if there have been any regions that have outperformed?

Tom Reilly

This is Tom. I will -- since I just returned from Southeast Asia, I'm kind of attuned to it. But, I'm very, very pleased with Southeast Asia's performance. And our international markets continue to be our strongest growing markets, led by Asia and then followed by Europe. And what we saw is basically 49% year-over-year growth in our international market. So, a very, very strong market for us and one that we are well-positioned, and one that the combined entity is going to be very strong in.

Unidentified Analyst

Perfect, thanks. And then, second question, I know you recently hired a Head of Sales, and I was wondering in the near-term, what the top priority for him will be?

Tom Reilly

Yes. So, our new Head of Sales, wonderful, wonderful individual, and he’s having a great impact. I always chuckle because he joined us two days before our merger was announced. So, we had a nice welcome party. His top priority is following through on the transition that we began three quarters ago, which was intended to continued our strong net expansion rate growth and focusing in on driving customer expansions and also building out our channel. And so, he's hit the ground running. What I find exciting is that a lot of the learnings that Cloudera has invested in over the last few quarters in understanding how to drive expansion, what's our target market, and how leverage channel is going to be directly applicable to the expanded customer base we have with our colleagues at Hortonworks. And so, they've been briefed on the work, they are as excited about it. And we look forward to driving that.

Operator

The next question comes from line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Your line is open.

Mark Murphy

Yes. Thank you, Jim. How did the in-quarter net expansion rate compared to that 120% rolling four quarter number? Are you able to just comment on that directionally, or should we refer from your comment that it was a little below that in-quarter?

Jim Frankola

Yes. We were I think 128% last quarter, 127% this quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis, which means that the in-quarter rate, by definition is a little bit less than 127%.

Mark Murphy

Okay, great. Now, as Michael had pointed out, I think the short-term billings grew about 10%, and the short-term deferred revenue came down quite a bit sequentially or more than it normally would. Is that 10% growth a fair indication of the overall bookings, glide path that you've got? Currently, I guess, while you're producing these very rapid improvements in the margin structure on the P&L? Is that a fair way to think about it? And also, just did anything in particular drag down that short-term billings number in terms of where that -- maybe some of the headlines from the planned merger had a bit of an effect here or there?

Jim Frankola

Once again, the Q3 billings, to the extent that they are off our long-term trends are noise. So, once again, we did fewer multiyear deals with prepaid in Q3 than we did in previous years. So, that impacts the short-term billings. We also just have the normal ebbs and flows of when transactions are closed versus when they are invoiced. I’m not overly focused on the 10% or so growth year-over-year. I’m more focused on what’s once again trailing 12 months number, which is somewhat higher. And then from my standpoint, the sequential change in deferred revenue -- that’s fairly typical for us. I don’t have exact amount for last year. But we typically see sequential declines in deferred revenue in the middle part of year, given our high Q4 bookings, which then gets billed and collected in Q1. And then we had a trough and then it increases again in Q4.

Mark Murphy

And just to clarify, this theory on our side is that when we look at the short-term billings it’s kind of stripping out the noise of the multi-year prepays year-to-year. So that’s why we’re trying to do that. But anyway, the last thing I wanted to ask, Tom, could you help us get our arms around the growth trajectory of some of the various -- very promising products you’ve got, some of the areas like Kafka and Kudu and Spark itself? Are there some vectors within that portfolio that are growing 50% or 80% perhaps?

Tom Reilly

So, there’s a lot of exciting things in the Cloudera platform and also in the Hortonworks. So, you mentioned Kafka as one area. Kafka has been a strong grower for us, and it’s getting great attraction in the enterprise. With Hortonworks HDF, or the Hortonworks DataFlow offering, it combines Kafka, NiFi and Spark stream into a very elegant platform, and we expect that to be a big grower for us. The next one I’d like to highlight is what we’re doing in Data Science Workbench. So, we’re seeing enterprises after many years of talking about ML and AI, suddenly maturing and saying, hey, it’s -- now is the time to start investing in machine learning and AI.

And so we -- in the quarter, we added nearly 30 new customers in that area. Today, we just announced our machine learning capabilities powered by Kubernetes. So, that’s another great area. If you combine HDF an Kudu, that is going to be a strong driver in IoT workloads. And then finally, our Cloud Data Warehouse is gaining traction. So, we have a play, which we call the Netezza step-up program as customers want to migrate from their traditional Netezza platform and they’re looking to build a modern architecture. What we’re finding is move from an appliance to a cloud environment and to modern software. So, our Cloud Data Warehouse is growing well along with data warehousing in general. So, those are all big growth drivers, Mark

Mark Murphy

Thank you.

Tom Reilly

And you mentioned spark, Apache Spark is like we’ve captured nearly every one of our customers on Apache Spark. So, earlier to the question about Hadoop, Hadoop was defined by MapReduce in HDFS, Spark has subsumed MapReduce in that traditional sense. HDFS is just one of many data stores we support. We like object stores as we find in the cloud and other environments. So, -- and Kudu being is yet another store. So, Spark is the center of our platform.

Operator

Your next question comes from line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.

Brad Reback

Great. Thanks very much. So, a couple of times during the call you guys have mentioned the idea of reinvesting upside synergies, cost synergies back into the business. How would you prioritize how much to reinvest back into the business versus letting fall to the bottom line? Thanks a lot.

Tom Reilly

I will tell you where we will reinvest and I’ll let Jim give you the balance. So from a product standpoint, number one priority is to accelerate our club roadmaps. Our two companies have the exact same roadmap and plans. So, we plan to accelerate that. Secondly when we talk from the edge to AI , we are going to invest in more on the edge capabilities and the AI capabilities. So, those from a product standpoint are really going to give you kind of a clear roadmap where we intend to differentiate and advance ourselves.

Jim will have the tough task of finding the right balance of how much goes to the bottom line versus how much we put forward to growth. And Jim, you can…

Jim Frankola

Just a little color. First of all, key thing, what we're signaling is that the growth synergies are looking good. The level of reinvestment will be a function of what we think the return on the incremental dollars are. So, step one is the build-up, call it a base case energy plan. Step two is to look in the various areas for investment, cloud, IoT, technical resources to accelerate customer adoption, assess what we think the returns are, both in short and long run and then deal that investment level appropriately.

So, you’ll hear more about that after we close Q4.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Sanjit Singh

I had just a couple of questions actually related to next year. So, Jim, I don't think we've moved to 606 yet. So, wondering if you could just sort of review just from a high level, what the major impacts you expect on the various revenue lines and on the cost side, how we should think about that? You can provide a framework of that. And secondly in terms of the backlog, that’ a metric that software companies have increasingly reported. I was wondering if you could give us any color on where sort of software backlog stands today as we start to think about 606 going into next year.

Jim Frankola

Got it. Mike Olson is wrestling me to take this question. Okay. So, 606, we’ve completed our historical work for 606. It doesn't have a big impact on our software revenue, at least for the past year or two. It does accelerate services revenue into the earlier periods. So, let’s call for software revenue, it will be plus or minus one, two, three percentage points we think impact for services, it might be between 5% or 10% of either drag or tailwind, depending on what period you're looking at. And once again, we'll provide all the details and the bridges once we close Q4.

So, I don't think 606 is going to have a big impact. And by way more broadly, the way we recognize the revenue the fact that most of our software is at its core open source, means that in general, most of our software offerings have revenue with very little upfront recognition. So, that is one reason why there's not much impact on 606. Regarding backlog, too soon. We're not as focused on it right now as we're closing the books and focusing on the merger. Let us get through the year and we'll look to what sort of disclosures at what level in a 606 world we’ll give you on backlog.

Mike Olson

Sanjit, this is Mike. The only thing I'll add to Jim's pretty good comments is that I was sitting across the desk from him and read the paper upside down. I thought we were implementing 909.

Sanjit Singh

I appreciate that Mike. And then, Tom, maybe just to wrap up for me. Just as we think about the integration task, you've been around for a while, both you, Jim and Mike, have all seen on mergers before in your careers. In terms of mitigating that, disruption risk that we're all well aware of, and past big integrations, what do you -- what is sort of your game plan in terms of trying to mitigate any type of sales assumption as we start to implement this big merger here between two companies?

Tom Reilly

Yes. So, my experience is and Sanjit, mergers are always challenging and disruptive. I think, this is unlike most common mergers, because our companies are roughly the same age. We have much of the code we ship is nearly identical code. Much of the code that not identical is complementary, we continue to ship it. So, there's very few products where we have to rationalize in pick one or the other. So, our product teams have come together very, very quickly. As a matter of fact, they are equally impressed. What Hortonworks has done with data playing services is very creative, open our eyes some great possibilities. Likewise, what they’ve seen -- what we've done with share data experience.

So, I'm very pleased how the product teams are coming out. In fact, many of our engineers already know each other because they collaborate in the open source community. So that is very unique. Take the sales. We're all worried about sales disruption. With fewer than 5% of our customers overlap and the majority of our growth coming from existing customers, there'll be very little disruption to customers and the account execs that they know. Our goal is to drive that down. And our customers are telling us, they can't wait to get access to the cross sell offerings.

I do know that Cloudera customers are very interested in Hortonworks data flow. And we'll be able to bring that to them day one.

So, every mergers are -- this one has its unique challenges, but the integration teams are ahead of schedule. Everyone is working extremely well together. I think we can minimize fuel disruption and bring value to our customers nearly immediately. Our customers, our partners are all happy. The code seems that we can deliver our new integrated offering in short time order. So. I am quite pleased.

Sanjit Singh

Very good. Thank you for your time, Tom.

Tom Reilly

Sanjit, we look forward to talking to you again. So, we're going to wrap up here. Thank you all for joining us. I know the markets are closed. This is a very special day for the nation, and we're recognizing the President’s passing. I do appreciate that you guys joined us for your thoughtful questions and for following us on this journey. It is very exciting. Our future earnings call will be as a new company. And we will be joined by our colleagues at Hortonworks. I think all of them for the great work they've been doing with us in the pre-merger, I look forward to doing this call as a new company that combines the best of Cloudera and Hortonworks.

Operator

Good afternoon. My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the New Relic Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

Mr. Tony Righetti of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.

Tony Righetti

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to New Relic’s second quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are New Relic’s Founder and CEO, Lew Cirne; and CFO, Mark Sachleben.

Today’s conference call contains forward-looking statements. Any statements that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections and future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our earnings release issued today, as well as the risks described in our most recent Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the SEC.

Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operational – operating results and trends. But note that these measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our earnings release issued today. At times, we may offer incremental metrics to provide greater insight into our business or results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.

I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations section of New Relic’s website to access our earnings release issued today, a presentation that accompanies our earnings release, periodic SEC reports, a webcast replay of today’s call or to learn more about New Relic.

With that, let me turn the call over to Lew.

Lew Cirne

Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon to everyone joining today’s call to review New Relic’s second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results. I’m pleased to report second quarter results that exceeded our guidance ranges with revenue of $114.9 million, an increase of 36% from the prior year, and non-GAAP operating income of $9.7 million, an improvement of over 1,200 basis points year-over-year.

These top and bottom line results, along with another quarter of steady sequential growth in enterprise ARR and accounts paying more than $100,000 are outcomes of the investments we made to further penetrate enterprise and midmarket customer accounts around the world.

Overall, we continue to build on our momentum from last quarter throughout Q2, as we’ve maintained a relentless focus on becoming the dominant DevOps platform for monitoring, managing and operating digital systems.

Sales execution during the quarter was outstanding and underscored by record non-APM bookings, which totaled more than 40% of new ARR. Once again, New Relic Insights and New Relic Infrastructure led the contributions with at least 10% from each product. We feel this demonstrate the advantage of being an application-centric 100% multi-tenant software as a service platform.

Let me explain. Being application-centric places us at the most strategic layer of the digital stack, the closest to the customer experience. Visibility into this complex layer is paramount for our customers, looking to drive top line growth for the digital investments. We do this better at scale than anyone in the market.

Now what’s really interesting today is that our target customers are rapidly adopting modern technologies at the infrastructure layer. Microservices, Serverless Computing, Containers and Cloud Computing, all of these technologies in service are running their application code. And it’s critical that they have complete visibility all the way from the mobile application or browser through the application running in the cloud and down to the underlying infrastructure.

New Relic uniquely connects all of these data points into a single platform. In essence, our non-APM products work in concert with our APM products to provide a valuable, holistic view of our customers’ entire environment.

From a go-to-market perspective, we continue to believe our greatest opportunity lies in activating the segment of the market that is not currently using a monitoring platform, which is, as we covered on previous calls, is majority of software in production today. Our investments in sales capacity are heavily skewed towards the activation and expansion of enterprises and driving ubiquity amongst developers, operation professionals and business executives responsible for enterprise side digital transformations.

We believe the return on incremental investments made in our customer solutions team over the past year had more than favorable impact, and is reflected in the highest Q2 dollar net expansion rate since fiscal 2013. When you factor in the significant ARR growth of our installed base during the same period, 124% dollar net expansion rate at our scale is quite an achievement, and it underscores how valuable our customers find our offering.

At a high-level, our customer solutions teams have been having success by focusing on three common yet critical technology initiatives that every company encounters today. The first cloud adoption to enable teams to have more autonomy in scaling their infrastructure; second, DevOps, to offer teams greater agility to deliver great products to market; and third, delivering a flawless digital customer experience to build their digital brand and impact their bottom line.

By aligning our go-to-market efforts with these foundational components to digital transformation, cloud, DevOps and digital customer experience, we are activating the non-consumption market by reaching new buyers. And because we’re attaching ourselves to their most strategic growth initiatives, we’re driving larger deals with broader product adoption, which is illustrated by the quarter-end totals for enterprise ARR now at 56% of our business, as well as in accounts paying more than $100,000 per year, which grew at 34% year-over-year and now stands at 786 accounts.

One of our enterprise customers that is consistently modernizing to stay ahead of the media industry is USA Today Network, which is having their digital moment of truth tonight, election night. They join me on stage at our FutureStack event in San Francisco, and we discuss how their team have prepared for peak traffic moments like tonight in order to share second by second updates with their readers as election results come in.

Inside the USA Today Network war room, New Relic dashboards help their team monitor the customers’ experience on mobile, browser and video on-demand. On election night and everyday, USA Today Network is deeply focused on the integration of technology and business performance metrics. They have turned to New Relic’s rich data to provide insight throughout their business, monitoring everything from modern technologies like Kubernetes, beginning visibility into their advertisers’ performance on over 100 media properties.

USA Today Network differentiates itself by delivering superior content and a modern digital experience, and New Relic underpins the technology innovation at the core of this strategic effort. An ongoing customer journey such as this is a natural outcome of product fit, sales capacity and market demand alignment. In order to capture more of these opportunities, we have set an aggressive hiring plan for fiscal 2019 and added a record 235 team members in the first-half of this year.

The bulk of these hires and those forecasted for the second-half of the year are designated for areas that have shown the largest returns, namely customer solutions and sales reps, as well as key product development hires. We continue to work hard to bring in world-class talent throughout the organization.

In closing, we are excited about the continued prospects of growth for our platform. We see no end to the trend of software being used more and more often to improve business outcomes from driving revenue to increasing productivity, to building brand value. Our multi-tenant SaaS model has the flexibility required to provide our customers meaningful value to these continual – continuously evolving modern digital applications.

This drives an opportunity for us that is much larger than application performance management, as we help our customers understand and connect data points from across their entire environment. In this scenario, our application-centric strategy positions us favorably within the technology value chain to continue moving upmarket and capturing an outsized share of the growing multibillion-dollar market for monitoring, managing and operating digital systems.

I will now turn the call over to Mark to provide more color on the financials.

Mark Sachleben

Thanks, Lew. During today’s call, fiscal year 2019 financial results are presented under ASC 606. A reconciliation table to prior year’s results under ASC 605 is available in the earnings press release accompanying this call.

Now turning to the financials. Revenue was $114.9 million for the second quarter, up 36% year-over-year. We ended Q2 with 786 paid business accounts paying more than $100,000 per year, up 34% compared to a year ago. This growth represents both new accounts landed, as well as installed base expansions derived from increased usage, expanded application coverage and the cross-sell of additional products.

Our dollar-based net expansion rate in Q2 was 124%, which is a slight uptick from the year-ago period, an encouraging result given increase in our installed base over the same period.

At the end of Q2, enterprise business was approximately 56% of ARR, up around 51% as of the same period last year. Our total paid business accounts remained over 17,000, relatively flat again sequentially. This metric is expected to continue to fluctuate moderately in the near-term as we focus resources toward opportunities upmarket within our installed base and optimize for economical growth at the low-end of the market. That said, beginning in fiscal year 2020, we will only provide fiscal year-end updates to this metric.

Turning to our geographic split. U.S. revenue of $78.3 million for the quarter was up 35% year-over-year, while non-U.S. revenue for the quarter grew to $36.6 million, up 37% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue represented 32% of revenue in the quarter.

Before moving to profit and loss items, I would like to point out that unless otherwise specified, all of the expense and profitability metrics we’ll be discussing going forward are non-GAAP. A full reconciliation between historical GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued today.

Gross margin was 85%. For the full fiscal year, we expect gross margin to decline modestly to around 84%, driven by expanding capacity in our U.S. data center and our new European region.

With regard to operating expenses, sales and marketing costs were $54.9 million, compared to $47.2 million in the same quarter last year. R&D expenses were $19.8 million, compared to $14.8 million in the same quarter last year. G&A costs were $13.4 million, compared to $11.8 million in the same quarter last year.

Overall, we had another strong hiring quarter. And as we stated earlier, we expect hiring in Q3 and Q4 to be robust as well. Operating income was $9.7 million, or 8% of revenue, compared to an operating loss of $3.5 million, or negative 4% of revenue in the same quarter last year.

The outperformance to our second quarter expectations was primarily the result of revenue upside, non-linear start dates of new hires and a larger portion of expenses being capitalized than anticipated. Overall, our net income attributable to New Relic per diluted share was $0.20, compared to a net loss per basic share of $0.06 in the same quarter last year.

Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with approximately $731 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, up from last quarter’s $721 million total. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, our total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $191 million, up 55% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, which compared favorably to our guidance range by approximately $14 million.

One contributing factor to our deferred revenue result was a two-year expansion deal with existing million-dollar ARR paid business account, which included full payment upfront. This deal increased non-current deferred revenue by roughly $8 million. As we look into Q3, we anticipate deferred revenue to increase on a percentage basis in the mid single digits from Q2.

Turning to cash flow. Cash from operations was $7.8 million. Free cash flow defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures and capitalized software was $600,000 outflow. For all of fiscal year 2019, we continue to expect cash from operations to be between $70 million and $80 million and free cash flow to be between $30 million and $40 million.

We now expect physical CapEx to be $40 million to $45 million, up from earlier expectations of $35 million to $40 million, primarily due to office build outs, later the consolidation of our San Francisco offices and additional data center capacity.

Now I will turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year 2019. For the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, we expect revenue to range from $118.5 million to $120.5 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income of $3.5 million to $4.5 million. This will lead to non-GAAP net income attributable to New Relic per diluted share in the range of $0.12 to $0.13.

For the full fiscal year 2019, we now expect revenue to range from $466.5 million to $469.5 million, an increase from our prior guidance of between $457.5 million to $462.5 million.

We expect non-GAAP operating income of $22 million to $24 million, an improvement from our earlier guidance of between $18 million to $22 million. This will lead to non-GAAP net income attributable to New Relic per diluted share in the range of $0.42 to $0.48, an improvement from prior guidance of between $0.39 to $0.46.

As our guidance indicates, we expect headcount and CapEx investments to ramp up in the second-half, which result in full-year operating margins at the upper-end of the expectations we signaled at the time for our Q3 fiscal 2018 earnings call of low to mid single digits.

And with that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.

Derrick Wood

Great, thanks. Nice job on the quarter. I wanted to ask on the net revenue retention rate that you’ve seen now five quarters of year-over-year improvement on that calculation. What are the drivers behind why this is getting better? Is it really just the mix of enterprise going up, or is there something within the enterprise that is also trending higher, whether it’s renewal rates or up-sells, et cetera, maybe give a little bit more color?

Lew Cirne

A great question, and I do think it’s a multi-factor – multiple factors that are driving the improvements that we’re delighted to see. First is, yes, the enterprise mix is now 56% of our run rate. And, of course, as that increases, enterprises have much more demand and we’re just such in the early innings of our enterprise journey within these customers that there’s just much more upside in those accounts, and so that helps immensely.

And then what we’re also seeing as a secular trend in our market is a desire to standardize on a single platform to see everything. So our enterprise customers are frustrated with having to switch between multiple tools to have a comprehensive view of what’s going on in the digital environment. They want to standardize on a single platform and they love that our platform is application-centric, it’s easy to use the software as a service, it works well.

And so that makes them, gives them more confidence to increase their spend, and we think there’s great opportunity in front of us, where we’re delighted that our average customer spends, what is about 26,000?

Mark Sachleben

Yes.

Lew Cirne

…per year, 26,500 per year per account. That’s wonderful news and that is up substantially again this quarter. But just think how much more room that has to run. There’s still only a little over 2,000 a month for a customer and we believe we deliver much more value than that to our enterprise customers, our potential is. So there’s a lot of room to run.

Derrick Wood

Great. And I guess, just a follow-up to that. I think that you guys have been focused on adding more technical people or SCs to support quota-carrying reps. I’m curious how much that’s impacting deal sizes or sales cycles or overall sales productivity? Is it too early or are you starting to see the impact of that?

Lew Cirne

Well, we’re seeing enough to know that we are on the right track. And again, as it relates to your – the way we’re answering that, because our customers want to standardize on a single platform to see the entire environment, the more completely they understand the breadth and depth of our platform, and the more successful although we’ll be doing that and more comfortable they will be stepping up to larger investments.

And so that makes obviously makes life easier for our quota-carrying reps. And so – and that’s been the thesis. And what we’re seeing so far is that thesis is bearing out into results. And that doesn’t mean that we’re done with that work, there’s more to do there. But our goal is to get our customers to completely understand the full potential of this incredibly sophisticated platform. And when they do, they step up to investing substantial amounts in our platform, because it delivers substantial value.

Mark Sachleben

Yes, Derrick, this is Mark. I’ll just jump in on that. Our best customers are our most educated the ones that know us best. And we believe that and hiring those more and more of those technical folks is a great way to help educate our customers.

Derrick Wood

Great. All right. Great job on the quarter. Thanks.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Ugam Kamat

Hey, guys, this is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So I just wanted to dive deeper into the multi-year deal that you signed with a customer. As you penetrate enterprise and that becomes a larger portion of business. Are you seeing more interest from the customers to lock in multiyear? And should we consider this to be like a normal course of business going forward, or is this just a one-time item?

Lew Cirne

That’s more of a one-time item, I would say. What we see is we see customers and you can see in our enterprise base, our customers are stepping up, they’re expanding. But generally speaking, our customers still – our enterprise customers still pay us annually upfront. And occasionally, we’ll take a – we’ll get a deal that’s multi-year, but that’s relatively rare and we don’t necessarily push for that. And I think that’s not the direction the market is going generally.

Ugam Kamat

Okay. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the Japanese joint venture that you announced in your press release? Any impact to financials, or any other go-to-market partnership that you have with them?

Lew Cirne

That’s – it’s very early days as you can – we just announced that relatively recently. So we think the impact in the short-term is going to be very modest. But we’re very excited about that opportunity. We’ve got a great partner that we’re in that joint venture with and we look at that market as being very attractive.

We have a fair number of customers already in Japan. But we think in order to really penetrate the market, to really penetrate enterprises like we would like to do and like we think we can do, we felt it was best – we best served going at it with a partner and thus we set up that joint venture. So long-term, we think they can have – we have great expectations for that venture, but the short-term impact we think will be very modest.

Ugam Kamat

Okay. Thank you so much, guys.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham and Company. Your line is open.

Jack Andrews

Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about how – if there’s an update in terms of how things are going with your IBM partnership? And then maybe just what the potential implications could be to you given IBM’s pending acquisition of Red Hat?

Lew Cirne

Sure. So we’ve been fortunate to partner with IBM for quite sometime and that they’re also substantial customer of ours. And I think, that’s one of the reasons why the partnership has worked so well. They have a deep appreciation of the breadth and depth of our platform and what can do for them, because they – some thousands of IBMers use our software to deliver on their digital projects.

So the partnership is going well, and we feel like they’re going to help us in particular reach certain enterprises that may be more difficult or expensive for us to reach on our own. We think Red Hat, the Red Hat acquisition, the interesting thing about that to me and I remember talking to Arvind a bit about this, about his vision of Switzerland of being like this independent or service provider that helps people on their journey to the cloud.

And in a way, we service Switzerland in our particular space, too. In that, our customers value the fact that an independent company is providing the visibility and monitoring they need as they run more and more workloads in multi cloud environments. They recognize that in order to be success with the cloud, they have to measure it and it makes supreme sense for the measurement to come from an independent party from the platform itself.

So, if anything, there’s just to draw a little bit of a parallel view to that, we run great in Red Hat environments, many of our customers run their workloads on Red Hat. So we believe that there’s just only more technical synergy as a result of the combination of IBM and Red Hat.

Jack Andrews

Great. Thanks. And then can I also just ask, Lew, if – what type of interest you’re seeing in terms of the New Relic developer program you discussed at FutureStack? I mean, I’m just wondering if there’s specifically an appetite for companies who maybe are not currently New Relic customers, but they do want to use the same APIs and tools that you’re using to develop your own software whether this could essentially serve as another, I guess, lead generation mechanism for you?

Lew Cirne

Well, the way I think of the New Relic development platform is, it really came out of this observing our customers and frankly, ourselves even. But every customer I visit, particularly enterprise customers start small, but small teams to build internal tools to round out the complete visibility of what they need to see in the production environment, because particularly in enterprises, every enterprise customer has something unique in how they report or what they do that also requires a bit of custom development.

And we recognize that there is so much in our platform that could accelerate that custom development to help our customers provide that complete solution to see exactly what they need to see measure – exactly how they want to measure it, presented exactly how they want to present it to evolve from being a tool to being a solution. And so, we wanted to – we begun our journey on making that – making it possible for DevOps and internal developers at our customers to customize New Relic to become that full solution rather than have to reinvent the entire wheel on how to collect and analyze and present performance data.

So that’s the vision developer platform. And while it’s early days, it’s resonating with our customers and we believe that it’s laying the groundwork for something that we think will result in much healthier and stronger customer relationships, higher value that we’re giving our customers and ultimately, better economics in the long run.

Jack Andrews

Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is open.

Fatima Boolani

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. This is Fatima Boolani on behalf of Jen. Maybe a question for you, Lew, around the non-APM bookings contribution, that continues to be very strong. And I want to better understand if there’s specific incentives you’re giving to sales organization in the form of quote retirement or additional kickers to really be able to sustain that level of non-APM level contributions? And then I have a follow-up as well, if I may.

Lew Cirne

Sure. No, we are not introducing any incentives or spiffs or anything of that nature to incent our customers or our sales reps to drive specific skews. This is a pull from the market. What we are responding to is the market demand to go from a collection of tools to a unified platform. And so often customers first discover New Relic because of our world-class and leading APM product, but then they recognize, “Hey, I would love to see other stuff in addition to the application performance and help”. And so it’s an easy conversation for sales reps to have to explain to them the breadth and depth of our platform and for them to.

They may start dipping their toe in the water with a product like Insights, but then they quickly see how powerful that product is and they grow their investment in that product over time, the same can be said for other products. So it’s great, because it’s organic and it’s natural and it’s an alignment with where the market demand is.

Fatima Boolani

That’s very helpful. And, Mark, maybe a question for you on the deferred revenue. I appreciate you sort of walking us through the one-time nature of the outperformance on the long-term side. But if I think about the multi-quarter effort around you sort of pruning, if you will, the SMB or lower level customer base. Can you help us think about sort of the go-forward inputs into the complexion of deferred revenue as those types of lower economic customers fade out of the model and you increasingly move up market and penetrate more and more into the enterprise? Thank you so much.

Mark Sachleben

Sure. So yes, I mentioned the one-time $8 million benefit that we had this quarter on the multi-year. In general, if you go back a few years ago and you had – we had a significant SMB base that paid us monthly. And that – over the last few years, that’s been changing, so that we have – our enterprise business is much bigger now and even the high-end of our SMB and commercial business, many of those customers have migrated to paying annually.

So over that period of time, we’ve seen a drift upward in our – well, for the first couple of years, it’s more than drift, but it’s a climb upward. But we’ve seen an upward drift in our duration. At this point, really starting, I think, probably a year or so ago, we mentioned that, that most of those impacts had run their course. At this point, we generally have – we’ll see that – we’ll see durations increase, but very slowly as our business mix shifts. But we don’t see any real meaningful impacts on deferred because of the duration and the timing of the difference in SMB versus enterprise customers.

That said, there are – every quarter, there are puts and takes about early renewals and/or someone renewing next quarter or co-terms, things like that. We tend to – that’s something we tend to caution around using billings as – our deferred revenue billings is too big an indicator of underlying the health of our business. It’s getting better, but there’s still lot of puts and takes in that number. We tend to highlight the ones that are most meaningful each quarter. But we think we’ll get better over time. But again, it’s still – there’s still some oddities to it every quarter.

Fatima Boolani

That was clear. I appreciate the color.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Gray Powell

Okay. Thanks for letting me ask the question. So maybe just a couple, if I can. Starting off at a high-level, how do you feel about the pace of demand as calendar 2019 approaches? And then do you see any changes in the macro environments or cloud migrations or anything at all that can influence growth in either direction?

Lew Cirne

It feels as strong as it has been historically. The demand is there. The demand is rich. Enterprises recognize that in order to be relevant and to win in their various areas of business, they have to succeed with digital. It’s not an option and it’s an increasing of their brand.

And so that’s driving immense demand for cloud computing. It’s driving them to adopt DevOps and it’s driving them to invest in digital customer experience. And those are the three themes that we attach ourselves to when we go to our customers and help them succeed in each of those. So that’s largely unchanged and that is healthy and we feel like we’re certainly not constrained by market opportunity for the foreseeable future.

Gray Powell

Got it. Okay. And then maybe a competitive question. So as an APM player that’s moving into the infrastructure market, what do you feel is your biggest advantage versus an infrastructure player that’s moving into the APM space?

Lew Cirne

Well, we believe that the whole purpose of infrastructure is to run applications. You don’t buy a computer unless you want to run software on it. And we believe the hardest most complex thing of the touch environment is the software, especially if it’s custom software. The thing that changes most often in the production environment is the software.

In fact, as I just stated earlier, businesses are competing on how effectively they succeed on digital. And in order to succeed on digital, you actually have to change software as rapidly as possible. Like I talked about USA Today Network on election night, they spoke on stage a year ago about how – on the election night two years ago, they were literally changing production in real-time as the election results were pouring in, in order to respond to what they are seeing in real-time, and that’s what helped them deliver a flawless election night two years ago for their customer experience.

And so if you think about your change – you’re not changing your infrastructure at that rate, right? So infrastructure visibility is very important, but we believe the harder more important problem to solve is the application. And so we’ve got a clear market leadership position in there. It’s where the most business value is, it’s where the most complexity is. And then we rounded out with the relatively easier problem solve of watching all the various pieces of infrastructure that throw off some data.

And so it’s not to be too dismissive of the technical challenge of monitoring infrastructure. We’re investing a lot in it. But we believe it’s – we’re kind of working downhill from a – and whereas a company or a technology that is infrastructure-centric moves the application, they’re going uphill.

Gray Powell

Got it. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line or Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Rishi Jaluria

Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, let me start, Lew. As you talk about your value with APM and infrastructure and all the different products that you expanded to, you’ve talked about how New Relic’s value prop is kind of having everything all together on the one common platform.

Let me ask about log management, because that’s kind of to me another area that’s tangential to what you’re doing. You’re partnering now with the likes of Splunk and Sumo and whatnot on that? But why not have a log management product of your own if that value prop kind of sticks out and having it on one platform versus partnering? And then I have a follow-up for Mark.

Lew Cirne

Sure. So what we’ve done today is prioritize our product roadmap on what we feel like has been the most important problems to solve for our customers that leverage our strengths and capabilities. And then partner in places, where they’re complementary sources of data that can further round out the visibility story. And, of course, logging – log messages are a complementary source of data that we believe support the primary source, which is what’s going on in the application.

So we believe we collect the primary data and then we augment it with some secondary data that come from log management solutions and we partner with many log companies. So that’s where we stand today. We’re continually asking our customers, where they’d like us to go next. We recognize there are many interesting adjacencies and it’s just a little too early to say, which adjacency will pursue next.

Rishi Jaluria

Okay, great. Thanks. And, Mark, more of a housekeeping question. But you saw a pretty big benefit from 606 this quarter, especially relative to last quarter, I think, about 3% on the operating margin side. Just how should we be thinking about what sort of benefit you’re getting from 6606 for the rest of the year until we head into FY 2020 and this hopefully doesn’t matter anymore then? Thanks.

Mark Sachleben

I’m trying to think what we’ve said historically. I think, we talked about, coming to the year, we talked about it being a couple of million dollars a quarter. And I think, that’s probably be going to be fairly consistent throughout the end of the year. The big benefit for us is on the, actually on the commissions – sales commissions the fact that we now capitalize them. And so the sales commissions tend to be a little bit larger in the third and fourth quarters, particularly with the enterprise focus we have where that – those quarters tend to be relatively strong. So we’ll have a slight uptick, I would say, in the 606 benefits as we get into Q3 and Q4. But I don’t think it’s going to be materially different than it’s been in the first-half of the year.

Rishi Jaluria

Okay, got it. Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Keith Weiss

Excellent. This is actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Sanjit. Given Mark’s warning not to look too closely at billings. When we look at current billings and adjust for like long-term deferreds, we still see your business doing extraordinarily well. And if anything perhaps accelerating from sort of what we saw over the past couple of quarters.

I want to ask two questions along that line. One, is there anything kind of turning on in the business, anything that you guys could point to that’s materially getting better, that could be leading to that acceleration or at least sustaining really good growth at scale?

And then two, more broadly on the competitive environment. There was a lot of discussion over the past quarter, particularly around the IPO of Elastic about a more competitive environment out there for you guys in the overall APM space. But what are you seeing in reality? What’s kind of like the view on the ground is the competitive environment really changing very much for you guys?

Lew Cirne

Well, to the first question, Keith, and it’s great to speak with you again is, we’d say what’s really kind of cranking for us or showing a lot of strength that, that is turning this business results, we’re very proud of is, in particular, the enterprise capacity. You recall when we went public that was very early days.

We had a small number of enterprise reps and we had to build enterprise brand and enterprise sales motion, the capability to support them and grow those accounts. And we’re never done on that journey. But I think it’s pretty clear, especially with 56% of our business being enterprise and we’ve demonstrated our ability to execute well there and succeed there, and that’s working well for us.

And yet, we’re just so early into an enterprise opportunity. We see that there’s plenty of growth in front of us if we continue to execute. Part of that is competing effectively. I think that the other thing that’s really been a great tailwind for us is, we were very disciplined about our commitment not to have an on-premise offering.

I can’t tell you how many deals we said no to five years ago, that would have – they said, if you can only build an on-premise New Relic for me, then we’ll bring you on and we felt like that would be short, it might give us some short-term benefit, but we regret it over the long-term.

We were glad we had that focus and that discipline to do that, because the market has now moved from a – moved to a place where they only consider on-premise offerings when they do RFPs many of these enterprise customers, particularly if it’s a modern workload running in a cloud environment.

So that all works in our favor, particularly in the APM space. And then as we go forward, we think being application-centric matters a lot to our customers. We believe running at our scale is a big deal for our customers. Our ability to support our customers in their digital transformations is quite well differentiated from our competitors offerings.

So there’s plenty of reason for us to remain excited and confident in our competitive position, and there’s no deal we don’t feel like we can win, particularly if it’s running in a modern environment.

Keith Weiss

Got it. That’s super helpful. And maybe if I can sneak one in for Mark. And related to that enterprise motion now becoming a much, much bigger part of your overall business. Can you give us an update or some additional color on how you guys are seeing sales productivity trending? Any kind of sort of milestones you could give us on how that’s been ramping up over the course of the year?

Mark Sachleben

I think, as Lew said, it’s been a great journey for us. We’ve learned a lot that we continue to learn a lot in terms of how to – how best to hire, how best to ramp reps and what to look for as we bring him onboard, everything from making territories and to how we structure the teams.

So I think those are things that we continue to learn, but those are things like we feel like we’ve gotten better at. And so, as we’ve done that, we see productivity increasing. And some of that comes from just duration of the sales team. Obviously, when your first 10 reps you hire them day one here, your average duration is pretty low. They’re not that productive as you get to the point we’re at now, where we’re growing that team pretty quickly, but percentage-wise, it’s not nearly what it was in the early days.

And so the duration starts to increase as you – as always, you can retain folks and those durations lead to nice productivity gains. So, we – we’ve still got work to do here, but we’re comfortable where – with where we are. You can tell by the focus we’ve had over the last couple of quarters on investing in technical support, technical services and technical personnel to supplement the reps that we feel good about those kind of investments.

So I think, we’re, as Lew said, I think we’re – we feel good about what we’ve accomplished, yet I’ll be the first to admit, we – we’ve got plenty to learn and still have a lot to do.

Keith Weiss

Excellent. Thank you very much, guys, and great quarter.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.

Steve Koenig

Hi, gentlemen, thanks a lot for taking my question. So I was really intrigued by your comment, Lew, at the – near the start of the call, where you talked about aligning your go-to-market efforts with the customer needs around cloud adoption, DevOps and customer experience. And you said, thereby activating non-consumption market by reaching new buyers.

So there’s a lot – I’m sure there’s a lot in that statement. Can you maybe just unpack that a little bit for us? What kinds of buyers are not consuming that you’re reaching more of now, or any other aspects of what you’re calling non-consuming market right now?

Lew Cirne

Yes. So let me clarify that a bit. I think primarily, it’s not necessarily new buyers in sort of different roles. It’s more – there are so many applications still today running production that do not have any APM product in place. And so the Gardner statement of something like, was it 20%?

Mark Sachleben

5%, currently 5%.

Lew Cirne

Yes, 5% growing to 20% – they have application workloads, it’s 5% today, or was as of – when they said that about six months ago and growing to 20% over the next several years. So that’s just such a massive opportunity in front of us, just we believe we’re a big part of driving that.

Now if you – when we survey our custom advisory board, it’s – the vast majority of their production environment is deployed with APM, because we’re democratizing the category. This isn’t something that people should choose to put on some of their applications, it just should be standard just like every driver should have car insurance, right? They shouldn’t just choose that car insurance for one of – for 5% of the population.

And so the reason why we’re democratizing the category is, our products are easy to use and they’re cost-effective to deploy and we figure out a way to do that in a profitable way with industry-leading margins, right? So that’s – that we’re going to leverage those strengths to democratize the category and recognize that that’s a massive growth opportunity for us.

Steve Koenig

Thank you. And that suggests that your Customer Advisory Board is in the vanguard, I mean, they’re the early adopters in this way of democratizing…

Lew Cirne

They are.

Steve Koenig

… of the category? What are – just my last question follow-up question. What are the attributes of the early adopters that should give way to more – to increasing mainstream adoption of the APM and more specifically of SaaS-based APM?

Lew Cirne

Well, these are the types of companies that were the earliest adopters of cloud technologies. These are the first companies to recognize that the more effectively they compete on software, the more successful the whole business will be. These are the companies that bought into digital as a strategy that will drive the top line of their companies.

The two type of people that think of playing offence with technology, technology as a top line can enable top line growth as opposed to just reduce the cost of operating in the back-office. And so that mindset five, 10 years ago was a bit avant-garde is becoming more mainstream. And that’s why so many companies are moving to the cloud now. But people who have that mindset tend to adopt New Relic – have adopted New Relic earlier and more completely adopted New Relic today.

Steve Koenig

Gotcha. Thanks very much.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.

Robert Majek

Hi, this is actually Robert Majek on for Michael today. As you go from 5% to 20% application workload penetration over time, how do you see pricing evolving just so we can get a sense of the potential revenue growth from that?

Lew Cirne

Well, I would say, we’re continually running experiments with pricing, little experiments here and there to use that as a way to fully optimize our business. When we first launched our product, we offered a dramatically less expensive product and that opened up a much larger market opportunity that grew the oversight of the APM market.

So if we believe – if we have enough data to suggest that adjustments to our pricing can help grow our top and bottom line substantially and really redefine the space to our favor, then we’ll consider that. But we’ll always do that with a lot of experimentation and thought and certainly discipline around anything that might impact our financial model.

As it stands today, we’re a value-based solution, even though we’ve got attractive pricing, we always sell on the value. And the customers who adopt New Relic and understand – and our serious with their digital operations, they see the value and that’s reflected in the dollar net expansion rate.

Mark Sachleben

Yes. I guess, I can just add on there that, we want to make it easy for our customers to consume New Relic. And a couple of years ago, we introduced now our cloud friendly pricing, we were the first to come out with something like that, where we offered another way to buy. So that we felt something was – it was neutral to New Relic, but just made it a lot easier for customers to deploy New Relic everywhere.

And when we think about pricing, we think about really account spend and how we can optimize the dollars coming from an account, where I guess, we look at our gross margins, they’re very attractive. We want to maintain those, but we think of – over the long-term what we want to do is, we want to see customer spend more, because and – conversely that will be getting a lot more value at New Relic and will become more important to them.

Robert Majek

Thanks. And then maybe just one more for me. Can you just give us an update on what you’re doing to expand internationally?

Lew Cirne

Sure. So we mentioned the joint venture in Japan that we just set up. Otherwise, we continue to expand in Europe, as well as our Australia. Our APAC business headquartered in Australia continues to grow. And our strategy internationally tends to be relatively focused. I think, we are, I would say, somewhat conservative in terms of entering new markets. We like to see a pretty good path to a market, where we can deploy resources and deploy them affectively and efficiently before we really jump into a country.

And so we’ve got customers all over the world. But when it comes to really focusing on a country, we can look at what customers we have already in the base. We can look at that market and then we’ll go after targeted countries, where we’ll put feet on this – feet on the ground, including both sales and a technical resource. And so we continue to do that primarily – in the near-term, it will be primarily in Europe. But we’re investing – overall, we’re investing internationally. We expect that to be a good driver of our growth going forward.

Robert Majek

Thanks a lot.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP. Your line is open.

Erik Suppiger

Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to come back to the sales expansion. How – what kind of a expansion percentage-wise in sales force are you expecting over the course of fiscal 2019? And what assumptions are you making in terms of the time required to reach full productivity for your new hires?

Lew Cirne

So we did not disclose the specific growth rates of the team or the size of the team. But obviously, we’ve put a path $2 billion out there. March of 22, we want to beat a $1 billion run rate. And so, you can imagine, we’re growing our sales team fairly aggressively to help us get towards that target.

For our enterprise sales reps, we assume about a year to four quarters to productivity – full to productivity. For the commercial and SMB teams, it’s a little bit quicker than that. But generally, those are the guidelines.

Erik Suppiger

Can you comment how your growth this year would compare in the sales organization would compare to the growth that you made last year?

Lew Cirne

We’re not getting to – into specifics. I mean, I guess to a question around productivity as you can imagine. If productivity stays the same, obviously, your sales capacity has to grow basically the same rate as your top line. We’re investing in non-sales resources aggressively as well. So I don’t want to get into too many of the details there.

Erik Suppiger

Very good. Thank you.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Jung Pak

Hi, thanks. This is Jung Pak for Keith Bachman. A question on international opportunities. You talked about Japan JV being a very modest help. But when can you expect revenue from Germany to ramp in a meaningful way?

Lew Cirne

We just announced – recently announced opening an availability zone in Germany, 20,000, a month, I’ll call it a month ago, I guess.

Mark Sachleben

Pretty recent.

Lew Cirne

Pretty recent. So, I think that certainly is, it’s a good publicity, I think, if – as well as gets our name out there. And so, that could help. We do have feet on the ground and we’ve made investment in Germany. We continue to grow that investment, and so we don’t give a country break-out of our international business. But we certainly look at that market as being attractive. You can see, you look at the cloud spend there, it’s a big – obviously a big market. So we expect to continue to invest there. And anywhere we invest, obviously, we’d like to see returns.

Jung Pak

Great. And a follow-up on the competitive dynamics. Are you increasingly saying elastic in the competitive process, or any change in the type of vendors that you’re competing against? Thanks very much.

Lew Cirne

No, we’re not seeing elastic at all to be honest. It’s a great search database. But it’s just different enough from what we do and how we do out of the box, specifically tune for performance availability. That’s just a very different thing from how we engage in the market.

So – and I would say in general, there has not been a substantial change in the competitive environment aside from what I’ve just shared earlier in that. But the market trends towards favoring SaaS delivery, favoring ease of use and favoring a platform that can go beyond just the application to see the entire environment. Those are all things that we think the market is continuing to ask for that further tilts the market in our favor.

Jung Pak

Thanks very much.

And there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks.

Lew Cirne

Well, I just want to thank, everyone, for joining the call and my hats off to the 1,500 New Relic’s for the exceptional work they’ve done in delivering a great quarter for our customers and our shareholders and a great first-half to the year. It’s obviously an important night in this country, and so we’re delighted that on election night we’re helping USA Today Network deliver a great flawless experience for those who want to see what’s going on in real-time with the election.

So that’s great. And we just encourage all of our customers and partners to come see us at the Amazon Conference AWS event coming up later this month, where we can meet you face to face and talk about helping you succeed with digital cloud and DevOps. And thanks and have a great evening.

Tien Tzuo

Thank you, Joon. This is Tien. Welcome to our third earnings call as a public company.

Tyler Sloat

And good afternoon everyone. This is Tyler. Thank you for joining us today.

Tien Tzuo

I am very excited today to talk about our third quarter. Let me start by saying that it was a great quarter. In Q3, we continued to deliver very strong financial results. We came in ahead of expectations across all our metrics, subscription revenue, total revenue, operating income, and EPS. Growth continues to be strong.

In Q3, we continued to see expansion in our total addressable market. Our market is predicated on not just more and more companies launching subscription services, but entire industries shifting. Over the last few months, we signed on Toyota, as well as Kia Motors, along with our existing customers, GM, Ford, Peugeot, and Renault. We are now behind the connected car initiatives of six of the world's top 10 auto manufacturers. This is an entire new vertical for us that didn't even exist five years ago, and it's a great, great example of how our strategy of landing and expanding within entire industries can lead to long-term durable growth.

In this quarter, we continue to see strong demand for our products, Billing and RevPro, both recognized as the leading solutions in their space. Regarding RevPro, now with the deadline for ASC 606 compliance has passed for many companies, you might think that demand for this product has significantly slowed. That is not what we're seeing, and we'll give some examples from the quarter demonstrating that revenue automation continues to be a big, big growth opportunity.

Finally, in this quarter, we continue to see growing momentum with our system integration partners, especially Deloitte and PwC, and I'll touch a bit on that as well. But before I continue, Tyler, why don't we open with the high-level results for the quarter.

Tyler Sloat

Sure, Tien. As you mentioned, when we look at Q3 we had another really good quarter. Later in the call, I'll go deeper into our key metrics and our operational and financial details. I'll also provide some financial outlook and guidance for the future, but now though, let me provide the highlights.

In Q3, we grew subscription revenue by 43% year-over-year, to $44.5 million. We grew total revenue by 33%, to $61.6 million. As a quick reminder, which we highlighted previously, the reason that total revenue grew slower than subscription revenue is that we had a big one-time uptick in professional services revenue last year related to our RevPro business. We'll have this year-over-year anomaly in Q4 as well, but we believe it should normalize in Q1.

We were able to accomplish this revenue growth while brining our non-GAAP operating loss down to $10.6 million, an improvement of $1.7 million versus the prior quarter. As we scale we continue to gain more leverage in our business model. All this led to outperformance on non-GAAP EPS, resulting in negative $0.10. We delivered results above our guidance range across all of these metrics.

Tien Tzuo

Thanks, Tyler; really, really proud of our quarter. Now, let me give you some color on what we're seeing in the quarter, which continues to give us confidence that we can sustain this level of growth over an extended period of time, years if not decades. The fundamental bet that this company is built on is the continued wide spread of the subscription economy that we're all seeing will lead to continued strong demand for the unique technology solutions that only we have delivered. The strategy behind this bet is what we call our Land and Expand strategy. Now, where other SaaS companies talk about landing and expanding within a single company, we focus our land and expand on entire industries.

Let's look at the technology sector, namely software and hardware, which is our first core vertical. Still represents about half of our business. The shift to subscriptions here is well known. It's led by the adoption of SaaS, cloud, and the preferences companies now have for these pay-as-you-go models. Today, we're behind both the SaaS companies, so Zendesk, [indiscernible], DocuSign, Avalara, Salesforce, as well as the more established players, like Symantec, PTC, and NetApp. Now, you all know how fast these guys are growing. The key here is, now that we are behind these leading companies in the sector, as the entire industry continues to shift to subscriptions this is automatically powering our growth.

Now, the same thing has played out with the media industry, starting with newspapers. Now, after going through years of hurt, newspapers today are finding growth again through the digital subscriptions. Now, we saw the shift early and began to focus on this industry years ago. We started working first with News Corp UK in 2011, and they publish the Times of London and The Sun. That helped us land the Financial Times later that year. Then Fairfax Group of Australia, in 2012; The Guardian, in 2014; The Wall Street Journal and The Telegraph in 2015; and then the Seattle Times, The Boston Globe; The Straits Times, of Singapore; The Bonnier Group, which publishes the biggest newspapers in the Nordics.

We also landed magazine publishers, like Time UK, which is now TI Media; Bloomberg; and Penske Media, who owns Rolling Stone and Variety Magazine. So you're seeing the network effect really starting to take hold. And we also expanded to other media companies like HBO, Perform Group, and also B2B publishing companies like S&P Global. Today, we're working with about 20 major newspaper publishing groups. We help them launch new digital offerings, experiment with new bundles, scale their businesses, and handle different payment methods around the world, like Amazon, PayPal, or direct debit.

Now, how do we know this sector is growing? Well, we can actually see it in our servers; transaction volumes for this segment, through the Zuora Billing system, have grown over 30% on average over the last five years. The perception that people won't pay for news turned out to be wrong. In fact, millennials are now the fastest-growing demographic. A 2018 Routers report showed that the majority of new subscriptions over the past couple of years is coming from people under the age of 35. And this signals long-term structural growth for the industry. So what does that all mean for us? It means that our early bet on newspapers has turned into one of our major growth engine.

The growth engine -- the growth rate that we've seen in subscription revenue from media and publishing companies has averaged about 35% a year over the last seven years, has become one of our largest verticals, representing approximately 13% of our overall subscription revenue. So you can see we're helping industries unlock growth through subscription business models which then powers our growth over an extended period of time.

Tyler Sloat

So, newspapers and publishing is a great example of our land and expand strategy within an industry. We line a few key accounts and enable them to execute against their growth initiatives. Then we close the other industry participants as they see the inevitable business model changes becoming pervasive amongst their competitors. But some would say that a vertical like publishing, which is a traditional subscription industry, naturally aligns itself to a digital subscription-based business model. What we've seen in recent quarters, and this is playing out in other vertical. One vertical team or highlight which most people don't think of when they think subscriptions or consumption-based models is automobiles.

Tien Tzuo

That's right. As I mentioned on the top of the call, we now have six of the top 10 auto manufacturers, with Toyota and Kia Motors onboard. But what's going on here? Probably obviously to anyone who's used Uber or Lyft that we are all very likely going to buy fewer and fewer cars over the next years and decades. Self-driving cars, when they come, will only celebrate this trend. So the major manufacturers, they all know this. And they're all turning to services for growth, content services, navigation services, diagnostics, analytics. A 2016 McKinsey report says that services could actually expand auto revenue pools by 30%. And if you've ever been down in the mall below the World Trade Center, Ford has a whole exhibit that showcases their vision from morphing from a car company to a mobility services company.

Now, we started seeing this a few years ago and began to execute the same land and expand playbook, picking up early leaders and then becoming the overall leader for the vertical. Today, in addition to the six of the top 10 OEMs, we also have Daimler Trucks, as well as connected services like Volkswagen's Wheel Service in Europe, OnStar, and Sirius XM. I think it's fair to say, we are now the leading provider of subscription solutions for the entire automobile industry. So what you're seeing is the same dynamics that play in autos as we did in newspapers, just staggered by about five years. And industry facing disruption looks to subscription revenues for growth, and they come to us, not only to handle the revenue complexity, but also to help them spin up new service and get to market faster.

We then become the system of record for a portfolio of well-known customers and we're set to grow with them, with the verticals -- with that entire vertical for decades to come. Now, I just highlighted two verticals, we hope to highlight further industries in future calls to come. Quick example, it's still early days, but we're seeing that we're starting to land Billing customers in utilities and financial services. They're all experimenting with these new services and subscription options. We've also got other membership-based organizations, like the YMCA that are in the midst of reinventing themselves with a wide range of new service models.

Tyler Sloat

So, to reemphasize, this is our core strategy, identify industries that are in the early stages of transitioning to a subscription business model, lock in the leaders for that industry, and as their subscription revenues grow we get to grow with them. And others in the industry follow suit. All this is in line with our intent do delivering consistent 25% to 30% growth rates over a very long period of time.

Tien Tzuo

The strategy is working. Now, what makes the strategy work, of course, is our technology. And we have not one, but two flagship products that we can use to land these customers, Billing and RevPro. They're both based on a simple concept to automate the financial complexities generated by subscription models. They're highly, highly differentiated, and they're mission-critical for our customers.

Now, most people know that our billing product is widely recognized as the best in market, but let's talk about RevPro. It's also recognized as the best product in the market. So for example, according to MGI Research, RevPro is the top ranked solution for revenue recognition software. For the last 90 days, we've heard a number of you ask for an update on the market demand for RevPro, especially now that many companies seem to be passed this ASC 606 deadline. So what we're finding is that many public companies rush to get compliance, but a lot of them just manually with Spreadsheets, and they found this to be a short-term band-aid solution. These companies are realizing that the real problem was never ASC 606, the bigger more systemic trend is that these companies were struggling to scale their revenue operations because of all these new flexible consumption recurring models that their companies were launching, and they couldn't do it with a manual Excel-based approach. ASC 606 is the thing that only highlighted the problem.

Let's give an example, a great example from this past quarter was Viva; most of you know Viva, they're a leader in the life sciences space, fantastic SaaS success story, and I suspect it's in many of your portfolios. Now Viva it's been public for a while, they're now talking about hitting the $1 billion of revenue next year, and what ASC 606 really put a spotlight on was how complicated revenue recognition has become for them. They spent a lot of effort to become ASC 606 compliant last year, but using manual operations, and then this year they came back to putting in an automation solution, and they selected RevPro this quarter to help them to efficiently scale this part of the business.

So you can see that the underlying demand hasn't gone away, but our value proposition is now more centered around automation and efficiencies, versus simply compliance. Not to see this quarter we also signed on other public companies like Carbonite and Pivotal, who both chose RevPro all because we've got the best revenue automation platform on the market, and there's a big, big difference between being compliant and being competitive. And that was the reason to bring on the RevPro product in the first place. The need for revenue automation is not just driven by ASC 606 compliant. It's a larger issue with many of these companies as the complexity of revenue recognition limits their ability to efficiently scale and meet their business goals. That's why we continue to see good demand for our RevPro product.

One last thing we cover about we saw in the business in Q3, and that's with our system integrators. I mentioned in the last call how Deloitte Digital helped bring a significant enterprise deal with Clarivate, which is a spin-out of Thomson Reuters. You may have seen this announcement earlier, but Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting in Japan recently announced collaboration with Zuora to help companies in Japan shift to a subscription-based business. This announcement is a great next step in our growing partnership with the Global Deloitte Network.

Second, we're building stronger ties with audit firms, strategic partners for our RevPro solutions. That's a closer deal acquisition actually about a quarter of our new RevPro customers have actually come through these partner channels. For example, P2VC and Zuora have a joint business relationship focused on addressing the growing demand for revenue automation software. In fact, P2VC has established a center of excellence to help customers succeed and using RevPro. Now honestly, we're still in the early innings of building leveraging these relationships, but we've got some great, great partnerships with system integrators around the world, and we really believe that over time this can turn into a healthy channel for our business.

So in summary, what we're seeing this quarter is good momentum in the market, continued expansion of the subscription economy across industries, which leads to an expansion of our TAM, continued traction for our solutions, and a growing ecosystem.

At this point, let me turn it over to Tyler to show how that's reflected in our financial results for the quarter.

Tyler Sloat

Thanks, Tien. I'll start with our key operating metrics and then I'll move on to our financial results and then guidance. We saw really healthy growth in both of our key operating metrics in Q3. Customers over 100K ACV maintained a solid growth rate of 30% year-over-year, improving on our Q2 growth rate of 28%. We added 30 more of these customers in the quarter and ended with a total of 504. This metric is important as this customer base continues to represent over 80% of our total ACV. In addition, we are continuing to grow with this set of customers as they grow as 28% of them had a transaction volume upsell in Q3.

Our second key metric is dollar-based retention. In Q3, dollar-based retention increased 115%. This is driven by incremental improvement to grow churn coupled with robust upsell activity. Last quarter, we talked about our long-term dollar-based retention settling near the high-end of the 108% to 112% range given our recent outperformance of metric, dollar-based retention may end up at the high end of this range or slightly better for fiscal year '19.

In addition to our two key metrics, we also saw transaction volume continue to expand through the Zuora Billing platform. In Q3, we processed approximately 8.6 billion in transaction volume, representing 37% growth year-over-year, and nearly 1.2 billion above Q2. This is important because our pricing model is designed to allow us to grow as our customers processed more transaction volume to our system.

So, now let's talk about how this translates for our financial results. Total revenue grew 33%, led by robust subscription revenue growth of 43%. Professional services grew at 12% for the quarter to $17.2 million. We mentioned previously that professional services growth was moderate this year as the ASC 605 to ASC 606 upgrade activity dissipates over time. In Q3, this upgrade amount was 600K, and we expect it to be even less in Q4.

Turning to margins, non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 78% for the quarter, in line with Q2; and non-GAAP professional services margin was negative 2% in Q3. We expect Q4 non-GAAP subscription gross margin to be similar to Q3. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin by another 4% sequentially as we've been creating operating leverage in our cost structure as we grow the business. An example of this operating leverage is the continued improvement in our growth efficiency index, which measures the efficiency of our sales and marketing spend. We measure our GEI by comparing our trailing 12 months non-GAAP sales and marketing expense of $89.1 million versus year-over-year increase in trailing 12 months subscription revenue of $45.9 million; for the GEI, the lower the number the better. In Q3, GEI continue to improve to 1.9, compared to 2.1 in Q2.

As we've said all along, our goal is to maintain or improve the GEI while achieving our long-term growth rates.

Tien Tzuo

Thanks, Tyler. So what you're seeing in our numbers is a balance between investing for future growth while continuing to drive overall efficiencies around business. So it's probably worth spending some time talking about cash flow and billings as investors often have questions about these numbers.

Tyler Sloat

Sure, let me start with cash flow. In our prior earnings call, we mentioned that we pushed some of our expenditures at the second-half of the year. In Q3, we saw some of this spend come through resulting in free cash flow of negative $10.3 million. We will see some more of late spend in Q4. In addition, we're applying a call in some spend from Q1. For example, we may have significant deposit related to new office space, and that will hit free cash flow. As a result, we continue to expect free cash flow of negative $42 million for fiscal year '19 in line with what we said last quarter.

Now turning to Billings, we've been consistent in our view, because of fluctuations from one quarter to another, in the long run, we believe focusing on the trailing 12-month subscription billings growth is a more accurate reflection on the overall business, and we expect this growth rates to settle and grow in line with our long-term revenue growth rate of 25% to 30%. As of October 31, trailing 12-month calculated billings was $245.1 million, representing 51% year-over-year growth. Professional service revenue as a proxy for professional services billing, calculated trailing 12-month subscription billings was $180.7 million, or 46% year-over-year growth.

One thing to note, part of our strong billings in Q3 is that we saw higher mix of annual billing terms and some Q4 billings were pulled into this quarter based on customer-driven timelines. On the Q2 call, we provided a 12-month billings growth number of low 30s percentage for fiscal year '19. Given our outperformance in Q3, we're increasing our expectation for trailing 12 months calculated billings growth to 45% for fiscal year '19.

Now let me finish the numbers with our current views on guidance and future expectations. For Q4, we're currently expecting total revenue of $62.3 million to $63.3 million, subscription revenue of $45 million to $45.5 million, non-GAAP operating loss of negative $12.5 million to $11.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.12 to $0.11, assuming weighted shares outstanding of approximately $107.3 million. This translates to full-year fiscal year '19 expectations of total revenue to $233.4 million to $234.4 million, subscription revenue of $167.1 million to $167.6 million, non-GAAP operating loss of $49.1 million to $48.1 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.56 to $0.55, assuming weighted shares outstanding of approximately 91.2 million. Tien, those are the numbers.

Tien Tzuo

Thanks, Tyler. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we consider Zuora to be a portfolio play for the entire subscription economy. This as a secularship that started 20 years ago in software, it took over digital media, and today it's in the midst of completely transforming manufacturing transportation, retail, and so many other industries. And I'm not just saying it because of the headlines that we read every day. I'm saying it because we can see it in the rapidly expanding and diversified nature of our customer based. We talked a little bit about newspapers and the auto industry on this call, and we'll continue to highlight key verticals as we see them continuing to build momentum.

I'm proud of the fact that we called it early, and we've got a 10-year head start on the competition, we've got the best solutions in the market in billing and revenue automation with a growing ecosystem of system integrators and other partners. We're in the early stages of a major shift towards recurring revenue in digital transformation that's going to take decades to fully realize, a vision that we call, The World Subscribed, and this is what's fueling our ability to build a long-term durable growth story. It's been 10 years, but in many ways it feels like we're just getting started.

We're happy to take your questions now. I'll turn it over to you, operator.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies.

Tien Tzuo

Hey, John.

Operator

John DiFucci, your line is open.

And the next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Your line is open.

Richard Davis

Hey, thanks very much. A few quick questions, one, I think you've talked about this in some of the conferences and stuff like that. But how do you feel like -- if I'm using Zuora, what kind of tools am I going to get that are going to give me heads-up that someone is going to turn off. And then related to that, when I think about myself or anyone, when you subscribe to something there's moment in time when you're kind of like, well, should I renew or not, and that can be true for Netflix or Amazon Prime. Talk about a little bit your customer success teams and how you make sure you kind of people right at that moment of transition, because once you're in I think it's pretty sticky, but you've seen this cycle before, so. Thanks very much.

Tien Tzuo

Yes, so one of the key things about the subscription economy. I was just on the phone on a conference call this morning with a major Fortune 500, Global 500 company launch new subscriptions, really transitioning. They're a product company today, but they're customers, both their B2B customers and their B2C customers are all starting to demand for these subscription services. And that was their question, is how do know -- what does success look like, right. You've got a chance to work with thousands of companies around the world, and one of the things we talked about is the swing factor, and the business model winds up being the churn relationship with the customers. These are active relationships. And you can tell based on the level of activity how strong they are.

So the key thing to all these things is really to put together a view of history of which customers are churning, which customers have an up-sell capability, and marry that with the internal measurements that you have. And I would say most, if not all, of our customers are using information from our system in order to do that. It's really part of being successful in this new business model.

Tyler Sloat

Yes, and Richard, I would just say also that the up-sell is as important as the churn right, and being able to identify through usage patterns and things like that from data that you can get out of Zuora on which customers you should be engaging with, and based on how they assign utility to your product. And you learn over time and then you can change your pricing and packaging to kind of optimize for that.

Tien Tzuo

And I'll give you a quick example of that. We talked about this in our Subscribed conference earlier, but our data that we could see across our customer shows, for example, two lessons, and you can go to the Web site for more information, but companies that do a usage-based model versus a fixed model grow faster. But there's actually a balancing act of how much of your business model is based on fixed and how much of it is based on consumption. And then companies where their customers come back and modify their subscriptions, right, they're actively involved in their subscriptions, if you will, grow faster. And on average, if one out of 10 customers actually come back and modify their subscriptions, those customers seem to grow twice as fast.

And the companies where on average every customer does a modification to their subscriptions every year, those companies grow three times faster. And so we can actually see this in our server as we publish all this information to our customer base, but that's why people come to us, right. People come to us because they see subscription business models as a big, big growth driver for their business. And they're looking to us to help them optimize how to capture that growth.

Richard Davis

That's super helpful. Thanks so much.

Operator

Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.

Stan Zlotsky

Hey guys. This is Stan Zlotsky. Hey, apologies, we're handing a couple of different calls today. So from my end, and pardon if that already has been asked, the Q4 billings, how should we be thinking about as we start to lap the Q4 billings and the inorganic contribution from a year ago as well as just a big shift to prepayments. And then maybe just a higher level question, the partner ecosystem, right, is a very important aspect of your overall go-to-market, right. How are you guys thinking about continuing to build out that partner ecosystem? What does it take to continue to get more certified professionals involved? And where do you see the contribution from the partner ecosystem really heading as we go forward? Thank you.

Tien Tzuo

Yes, I'll do the partner one, and then I'll turn it over to Tyler to talk about billings. We chose to really highlight the partner ecosystems because we can definitely see that it's growing in importance. And whether it's on the revenue recognition side, right, these are projects deep into the CFO department, the VP of revenue department, and the auditing companies are very much involved in these. And so we highlight that 25% of the business is actually coming through that channel.

On the Billing side, it's a little more complicated. These are digital transformation projects. You're going to see Accenture there, you're going to Deloitte, you're going to see a bunch of these other companies, right. And so what I would say is we're working with a lot of these companies. We have certification programs in place. And you're going to see us talking more about that in the future. But it's something that we're pretty excited about.

Tyler Sloat

Hey, Stan, this is Tyler. Let me just touch on your billings question, I think you asked about Q3 and Q4 billings, and what to expect there. So, look, Q3 was a really good billings quarter. We called out two things that also contributed to that, which was kind of a pull-in a little bit of Q4 billings into Q3, which we do see some of that every quarter. And we saw a decent amount in Q3. But also, there was a change in our billing terms that we normally see. And there's just some quirky things and fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter that we'll see over time. In general though, we're very pleased with the billings growth. We actually raised the guidance to 35% for the year, the trailing 12 months. And we want everybody to focus on that trailing 12 months, but that's also the reason we raised.

Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham.

Scott Berg

Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess a couple here. Tien, you guys called out net dollar retention being better for a couple of reasons, but one of them was around gross retention being better. You guys put anything, any systems or anything in place to actively manage that to be a little bit better or is there something that's maybe being more over the next quarters to next couple of years?

Tien Tzuo

Well, you obviously understand that companies have subscription model churn is going to have a big swing effect here. So it's something that I wouldn't say there's anything new that we've put in place in the last 90 days. But it's obviously a huge focus of ours, and we hope to continue to show continuous improvements year-over-year on these numbers. And so we feel really good. I think we're benefited from the fact that we have a very sticky product. And when you look at our product, once it goes in, whether it's on billing on the revenue recognition side, right, it's sticky. It's running the company's core operations; it's the heart of the businesses.

And so the two factors for us that influence churn are, one, how well are we doing brining customers live, and that's where we continue to show improvements year-over-year. The second, probably more subtle is -- are these businesses surviving. And I'd say every year that passes the importance of subscription revenue streams to the companies that are launching them increases. And so I'd say, five, six, years ago these might've been science projects where they tried something; they shut it down after a year or two. We're not really seeing that happen anymore, right. These are strategic initiatives; they're part of a company's digital transformation initiative. And so that really points to the fact that as the subscription economy continues to mature, and we want to emphasize that it's still early innings, right, then that gives us an enormous amount of tailwinds on our business.

Scott Berg

Got it, helpful. And then from a follow-up perspective with the partner question that was just answered is, I've seen that the last couple of years' partners are becoming a bigger influence into your business. One of the things that I think have picked up over the last six months is these deals that partners are wrapping around your solution are getting larger, and you're a significant component of it, which is, I think, talks a lot about the value of what the Zuora platform holds for these customers. But sometimes they get worried that as these deal sizes get significantly larger it could actually slow down sales cycles because they just take longer to get approval and whatnot. Is that something you're seeing or worried about or is the momentum in these larger deals just all-around goodness for the business today?

Tien Tzuo

Yes, so you're absolutely right. These are big digital transformation initiatives. And which requires a set of systems that go in. If you looked recently at Dreamforce, Salesforce's conference, Deloitte actually announced a manufacturing stack, if you will, manufacturing digital transformation stack, and we're embedded in that stack. And I think there was an announcement from Deloitte during the time of Dreamforce around that. And so that's a lot of positive news for us.

The second part is does that mean these deal cycles are growing longer. I think what happens is we manage our sales organization, our pipeline very carefully. And so only when there is a budgeted project that we know is going to happen do we actually then call that a deal. And when that happens, that's how you keep your deal cycles short, right. Because it's a known project, the company is going to do something, there's a known decision timeframe. And if there's a broader interest but they're not ready to move, we put that in our marketing bucket, if you will. We continue to engage with our customers, we invite them to our events. But you have to build a sales process that allows you to have conversations with customers before they're ready, but really measure them as true deal cycles when they're ready. And that's how we keep our deal cycles pretty consistent regardless of the size of the projects or whether a system integrator is involved.

Scott Berg

Got it, super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is open.

John DiFucci

Yes, thanks guys. And sorry about the technical difficulties, I am a technology analyst but I can't work a phone. Sorry about that.

Tien Tzuo

Good morning, John.

John DiFucci

So, I want to go in back to Scott's first question, on the net retention, which is pretty -- that's a lot better than we've talked about over the years, and since even last quarter. So can you tell us, Tyler, like how much of that - like, agreeing we know the net retention like all of last year was -- it was 110%, and I'm just curious, like so now this is 115%, the delta there, like how much of that is from the gross improvement? And then on top of that, the up-sell part of it, is that more from existing customers coming back and, let's say, a Billings customer comes back and buys RevPro or even CPQ, or Collect or something, another product. Or are they primarily buying more capacity in what they started with, whether that's Billing or RevPro?

Tyler Sloat

Yes, that's a good question, John. I think there's two questions embedded in there. So how are we doing kind of our gross churn there, and then where on the up-sell side there's a contribution to net retention, where is it coming from? So, we've said in the past, we're really happy about what we've been able to do on the gross churn side. And we keep getting better at it. And Tien mentioned earlier because Scott asked, what have you done, it's nothing in the last 90 days. But it's all about - these are more serious projects for customer so they end up true initiatives for them. Second, we're getting really good at and implementing customers. And then kind of lastly, they're growing with us.

And so that gets to the second piece, which is where is the up-sell coming from. We mentioned we got up-sells from cross-sales of products, and that is RevPro and Billing. We highlighted a few customers for RevPro that are also Billing customers. Nothing has changed there in terms of the less than 10% overlap still, which we think in the long run all of our customers are going to need both of these products; they're very, very synergistic. And we've been very open about focusing, not necessarily on the cross-sale of that, but of closing new deals. The continual majority of our up-sell still comes from transaction volume, which is one of the reasons we highlight that number, at over $8 billion, that it's just a really good number. And that it just is a testament to that customers are using the system, but that we're going to continue to be able to grow with them as they continue that transaction volume.

John DiFucci

Great. And could you just tell us, it is one percentage point, is it two from the gross improvement, like even year-over-year, the delta in those -- I know I'm pushing, but you know it's an important to me anyway.

Tyler Sloat

Yes, your gross churn rate, I mean, John, you and I have talked a lot about this. And I think, again we're not going to give the exact percentage, but we just keep getting better and better at churn, and we're really happy with it.

John DiFucci

Yes, okay.

Tien Tzuo

Yes, I think the key this is it's -- that it's not going to be other. It's a combination of both together that really drive the benefit, right, the reduction in churn, and also the ability to grow with our customers as they put in transaction volume. I think that's why we chose to highlight that we call that the land and expand strategy, right, and most companies think land and expand is starting inside of a company growing larger, you know, and that's why I mentioned we tend to have a larger land, but across the industry that's the way we like to look at it, where we go into newspapers, we go into auto, we have a fair deal that gets them in, and help them launch their services faster, how can it iterate, how can be successful, and then we can grow as the industry grows. And so, that's how we're building multiple growth engines inside of the company. We've got a growth engine in tech. We've got a growth engine in media. We've got a growth engine that's emerging in auto, and we're going to continue to see that, and you're going to see us really top like that, and the net dollar retention is really, you know, you can see as a number that's really part of that strategy.

John DiFucci

Great. Well, thanks. Nice job guys, thank you.

Tien Tzuo

Thanks, John.
